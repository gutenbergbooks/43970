<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>A picture of some phases of life in the early days of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony is presented in the following
pages; lightly sketched, as much of the detail has become
dim or has disappeared with the passage of years, it never
having been placed on record even among the traditions. For why
keep an exact record of doings with which every one is familiar?
It follows that many of the every day happenings, the manners
and customs of daily life&mdash;much of the intimate detail of
existence in the Colony, in the seventeenth century, have been lost
forever.</p>

<p>Few realize how modern are the furnishings and comforts of our
present-day houses and how different was the home life of our
ancestors. Chairs were unknown in ordinary English households
until a generation or so before the sailing of the <em>Mayflower</em>. Hats
were worn at meals and the use of table forks did not become general
until the last of the 1600s. Food was placed in the mouth with
the knife or the fingers. Washing the hands and face was not considered
essential on rising from bed in the morning and few of
the laboring classes in any country in Europe washed their faces
every day.</p>

<p>This is a collection of source materials, somewhat digested, rather
than a comprehensive, well-balanced narrative of daily life in the
Colony&mdash;an impossible task at this late day. Moreover, the exact
limitations of the Colonial Period have not been observed too
closely as it has seemed desirable to include some material from
newspapers and other later sources.</p>

<h2>Every Day Life in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Voyage To Massachusetts</span></h3>


<p>"Before you come," wrote Rev. Francis Higginson, the first
minister at Salem, "be careful to be strongly instructed
what things are fittest to bring with you for your more
comfortable passage at sea, as also for your husbandry occasions
when you come to the land. For when you are once parted with
England you shall meete neither markets nor fayres to buy what
you want. Therefore be sure to furnish yourselves with things fitting
to be had before you come: as meale for bread, malt for
drinke, woolen and linnen cloath, and leather for shoes, and all
manner of carpenters tools, and a great deale of iron and steele to
make nails, and locks for houses, and furniture for ploughs and
carts, and glasse for windows, and many other things which were
better for you to think of there than to want them here."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Elsewhere
the good pastor set down "A catalogue of such needfull
things as every Planter doth or ought to provide to go to New
England" in which he enumerated the necessary victuals per person
for the first year, viz.:</p>

<p>"8 Bushels of meale, 2 Bushels of pease, 2 Bushels of Otemeale,
1 Gallon of Aquavitae, 1 Gallon of Oyle, 2 Gallons of Vinegar, 1
Firkin of Butter; also Cheese, Bacon, Sugar, Pepper, Cloves,
Mace, Cinnamon, Nutmegs and Fruit."</p>

<p>The household implements listed were: "1 Iron pot, 1 Kettel,
1 Frying pan, 1 Gridiron, 2 Skellets, 1 Spit, Wooden Platters,
Dishes, Spoons and Trenchers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Higginson listed in detail the food supplies required per
person for a year, including a good variety of spices; and also the
clothing for a man, which included a Monmouth cap, a suit of
canvas, a suit of freize, a suit of cloth, four pairs of shoes, three
shirts and three falling bands, a pair of blankets, a coarse rug and
seven ells of canvas with which to make a bed and bolster. The
settler must also bring with him a complete armor, with a long
piece, sword, bandoleer and ammunition, tools for cultivating the
soil and for working wood, and also household implements&mdash;a limited
equipment, comparable with the kit packed by the scout or
mining prospector of more recent times.</p>

<p>On looking backward over the span of three centuries, Time
lends an enchantment to these Puritan forefathers of present-day
Massachusetts. Worshiping descendants have placed halos about
their heads and the hardships of life during the early years have
been magnified to the extent that these independent-minded Englishmen
have become types of suffering fortitude&mdash;martyrs to the
noble cause of free religion and self-government. That is a long
tale, however, carrying with it many qualifications, and cannot be
enlarged upon here. In what follows, it should always be borne in
mind that aside from the Dutch at New Amsterdam and the small
colony of Swedes on the Delaware, it was English stock that settled
the American colonies and that these men and women brought with
them a background of generations of English life. Their standards
of living, manner of working their trades and natural aptitude for
barter and commerce were all modeled upon English life and
customs. It was only natural that this should be so. The ships
crossed the Atlantic at comparatively frequent intervals and their
holds came filled with all kinds of necessities and luxuries required
by English standards of living&mdash;foodstuffs, fabrics and implements
which the shops of London, Plymouth or Bristol could supply and
which could not be produced by the American settlements. To
obtain these refinements of life the colonists required only money
or merchandise. Lumber, raw or manufactured, salted fish, beaver
and peltry, plantation-built vessels and other products of the colonies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
could be easily converted into the comforts of English life
for sale in the shops across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The Rev. Francis Higginson came over in the <em>Talbot</em>, a ship of
three hundred tons burden, which was armed with nineteen guns
and carried a crew of thirty men. She brought over one hundred
passengers. Sailing with her was the ship <em>George</em> of three hundred
tons, in which came fifty-two passengers and a stock of cattle,
twelve mares, thirty cows and some goats. From the original records
of the Massachusetts Bay Company in New England we learn
what food supplies were shipped on board the <em>Talbot</em> for the
American voyage. The amount was supposed to be sufficient for
one hundred and thirty-five men for three months. As a matter of
fact, the voyage from Gravesend to the anchorage in Salem harbor
occupied sixty-eight days.</p>

<p>The ship carried 22 hogsheads of salted beef, 12,000 of bread
(biscuits), 40 bushels of peas, 20 barrels of oatmeal, 450 pounds
of salt fish, 10 firkins of butter and 1,200 pounds of cheese. To
wash down this food they took on board 6 tons of water, 45 tons
of beer, 20 gallons of brandy, 20 gallons of Spanish wine (Malaga
and Canary), 2 tierces of beer vinegar and 20 gallons of olive oil.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
During the voyage two died of smallpox, including a blasphemous
seaman. A child died of consumption and a dog fell overboard and
could not be recovered. The rest came through and reached Salem
harbor in a good state of health.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Bay Company seems to have maintained a
"company store," in the modern phrase, at which the colonists
might obtain clothing, fabrics, foodstuffs and supplies of all sorts.
When Governor Endecott came over in 1628, the Company sent
extra clothing sufficient for one hundred men including three hundred
suits of clothes, four hundred shirts and four hundred pairs of
shoes. Two hundred of the suits of clothes consisted of doublet and
hose made up of leather, lined with oiled skin leather, and fastened
with hooks and eyes. The other suits were made up of Hampshire
kerseys, the doublets lined with linen and the hose with skins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
There were a hundred waistcoats of green cotton bound about with
red tape, a hundred Monmouth caps, at two shillings each, five
hundred red knit caps, milled, at five pence each, and one hundred
black hats, lined in the brows with leather. This store supplied the
natural wear and tear of headgear among the hundred men. The
stock contained four hundred pairs of knit stockings, ten dozen
pairs of Norwich garters, three hundred plain falling bands, two
hundred handkerchiefs and a stock of sheer linen with which to
made up other handkerchiefs. Scotch ticking was supplied for
beds and bolsters, with wool to put therein. The blankets were
of Welsh cotton and fifty rugs were sent over to place over the
blankets, while mats were supplied "to lye vnder 50 bedds aboard
shippe."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>During the ten years that followed the settlement of the Massachusetts
Bay, a continuous flow of emigration from England
crossed the Atlantic in all kinds of available sailing craft.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The passage
usually cost &#163;5 per person and this included provisions provided
by the ship such as "salt Beefe, Porke, salt Fish, Butter,
Cheese, Pease, Pottage, Water-grewell, and such kinde of Victualls,
with good Biskets, and sixe-shilling Beere; yet it will be
necessary to carry some comfortable refreshing of fresh victuall.
As first, for such as have ability, some Conserves, and good Clarret
Wine to burne at Sea; Or you may have it by some of your Vintners
or Wine-Coopers burned here, &amp; put into Vessels, which will keepe
much better than other burnt Wine, it is a very comfortable thing
for the stomacke; or such as are Sea-sicke: Sallat-oyle likewise,
Prunes are good to be stewed: Sugar for many things: White
Biskets, and Egs, and Bacon, Rice, Poultry, and some weather-sheepe
to Kill aboard the Ship: and fine flowre-baked meates, will
keepe about a weeke or nine days at Sea. Iuyce of Lemons well put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
up, is good either to prevent or curre the Scurvy.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Here it must
not be forgotten to carry small Skillets or Pipkins, and small frying-panns,
to dresse their victualls in at Sea. For bedding, so it be
easie, and cleanly, and warme, it is no matter how old or coarse it
be for the use of the Sea: and so likewise for Apparrell, the oldest
cloathes be the fittest, with a long coarse coate to keepe better things
from the pitched ropes and plankes. Whosoever shall put to Sea in
a stoute and well-conditioned ship, having an honest Master, and
loving Seamen, shall not neede to feare, but he shall finde as good
content at Sea, as at Land.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Mayflower</em> shipped 15,000 brown biscuit and 5,000 white,
that is, hard bread, i.e. crackers; also smoked or half-cooked bacon,
as it came from the smokehouse, which was much liked with the
biscuit and when fried was considered a delicacy. Haberdyne (dried
salted codfish) was also a staple article of diet; also smoked herring.
Potatoes were practically unknown at that time and the store
of cabbages, turnips, onions, parsnips, etc., soon ran short and gave
way to boiled mush, oatmeal, pease puddings, etc. Their beer was
carried in iron-bound casks.</p>

<p>When passengers came aboard vessels bound for New England
in those early days, how did they stow themselves and their possessions?
The <em>Mayflower</em> had a length of about 110 feet and measured
about 244 tons. It was originally intended that she should
carry ninety passengers, men, women and children, but when the
<em>Speedwell</em> put back, twelve of her passengers were taken aboard,
and two boys were born during the voyage. The ship also carried a
crew of twenty to twenty-five men, and officers and petty officers,
about sixteen in number, would bring the total of those aboard to
one hundred and forty or more. Goats, pigs, and poultry occupied
pens on the upper or spar deck and in the boats carried there. Small
sleeping cabins were provided for the ship's officers and the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
important passengers; most of the company slept in narrow bunks,
in hammocks, and on pallet beds of canvas filled with straw, placed
on the deck beneath the hammocks. The crew bunked in the forecastle.
The chests and personal possessions of the passengers were
stowed below on the lower deck where the food, water and ship's
stores were kept. On the <em>Arbella</em>, Governor Winthrop's ship, the
male passengers lodged on the gundeck and four men were "ordered
to keep that room clean."</p>

<p>The ship <em>Whale</em>, in 1632, brought thirty passengers, including
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Dummer, all in good health, and seventy
cows of which they lost but two. The ship <em>Regard</em> of Barnstaple,
200 tons, arrived in 1634, brought twenty passengers and about
fifty cattle. The ship <em>Society</em> of Boston, N. E., 220 tons, with a
crew of thirty-three men, arrived in 1663, with seventy-seven passengers.
A notable example of fortitude is found in the voyage of
the sloop <em>Sparrow Hawk</em>, that sailed from London in 1626 for
Virginia and having been blown off her course was wrecked on
Cape Cod.</p>

<p>She was only forty feet in length, had a breadth of beam of
twelve feet and ten inches, and a depth of nine feet, seven and one-half
inches. Bradford in his <cite>History</cite> records that she carried
"many passengers in her and sundrie goods ... the cheefe amongst
these people was one Mr. Fells and Mr. Sibsie, which had many
servants belonging unto them, many of them being Irish. Some
others ther were y<sup>t</sup> had a servante or 2 a piece; but y<sup>e</sup> most were
servants, and such as were ingaged to the former persons, who also
had y<sup>e</sup> most goods ... they had been 6 weeks at sea, and had no
water, nor beere, nor any woode left, but had burnt up all their
emptie caske."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And this happened in the month of December!</p>

<p>In those days cooking on shore was done in an open fireplace. On
shipboard, the larger vessels were provided with an open "hearth"
made of cast iron sometimes weighing five hundred pounds and
over. More commonly a hearth of bricks was laid on deck, over
which stood an iron tripod from which the kettles hung. More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
crudely still a bed of sand filled a wooden frame and on this the
fire was built, commonly of charcoal. On the ship <em>Arbella</em>, in which
came Governor John Winthrop and his company, in 1630, the
"cookroom" was near a hatchway opening into the hold. The captain,
his officers and the principal men among the passengers dined
in the "round house," a cabin in the stern over the high quarter-deck.
Lady Arbella Johnson and the gentlewomen aboard dined in
the great cabin on the quarter-deck. The passengers ate their food
wherever convenient on the main deck or in good weather, on the
spar deck above. Years later, a new ship lying at anchor in Boston
harbor was struck by lightning which "melted the top of the iron
spindle of the vane of the mainmast" and passing through the long
boat, which lay on the deck, killed two men and injured two others
as "they were eating together off the Hen-Coop, near the Main
Mast."</p>

<p>The ship supplied each passenger with a simple ration of food
distributed by the quartermasters, which each family or self arranged
group of passengers cooked at a common hearth as opportunity
and the weather permitted. Of necessity much food was
served cold and beer was the principal drink. John Josselyn, Gent.,
who visited New England in 1638, records "the common proportion
of Victualls for the Sea to a Mess, being 4 men, is as followeth:</p>

<p>"Two pieces of Beef, of 3 pound and &#188; <em>per</em> piece.</p>

<p>"Four pound of <em>Bread</em>.</p>

<p>"One pint &#188; of <em>Pease</em>.</p>

<p>"Four Gallons of <em>Bear</em>, with <em>Mustard</em> and <em>Vinegar</em> for three
flesh dayes in the week.</p>

<p>"For four fish dayes, to each Mess <em>per</em> day, two pieces of <em>Codd</em>
or <em>Habberdine</em>, making three pieces of fish.</p>

<p>"One quarter of a pound of <em>Butter</em>.</p>

<p>"Four pound of <em>Bread</em>.</p>

<p>"Three quarters of a pound of <em>Cheese</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Bear</em> is before.</p>

<p>"<em>Oatmeal per</em> day, for 50 men, Gallon 1. and so proportionable
for more or fewer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The settler also must take with him a supply of food to answer
his needs on reaching Massachusetts, and it was advised that enough
for the space of a year might be required in which case each person
should be certain to have in store 8 bushels of meal, 2 bushels pease,
2 bushels oatmeal, 1 gallon brandy, 1 gallon oil and 2 gallons vinegar.
Sugar could be had in New England as the Colonial vessels
were bringing it from the West Indies in the way of trade, but
spices, necessary to the English diet, must be brought from England.</p>

<p>The above prices are estimated costs in England and the freight
on the same would be reckoned at the rate of half a ton per person.</p>

<p>The vessels which carried the great emigration to New England
between 1630 and 1640 were of small tonnage and the passenger
accommodations on board were limited in space and barren of
creature comforts. Small wonder that the health of many of the
first settlers, shaken by the passage at sea, paid toll to the severity
of the New England climate&mdash;the biting cold of the winter and
the heat of the summer days to which they were unaccustomed.</p>

<p>"It was not because the Country was unhealthful, but because
their bodies were corrupted with sea-diet, which was naught, their
Beefe and Porke being tainted, their Butter and Cheese corrupted,
their Fish rotten, and voyage long, by reason of crosse Windes, so
that winter approaching before they could get warme houses, and
the searching sharpnes of that purer Climate, creeping in at the
crannies of their crazed bodies, caused death and sickness."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The ship <em>Talbot</em>, on which Mr. Higginson sailed, brought over
one hundred passengers and thirty seamen. She measured nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
eighty-six feet in length and had a depth of hold of eleven feet.
By present-day measurement she was about two hundred tons
burden. The space between decks, where the passengers slept and
spent much time during the dreary voyage, was so low that a tall
man could not stand erect, and whenever a severe storm arose, so
that the ports and hatches must be kept closed, the air below deck
in time must have become intolerable. Such a storm arose when
the <em>Talbot</em> was thirty-three days out and "ye wind blew mightily,
ye sea roared and ye waves tossed us horribly; besides it was fearfull
darke and ye mariners made us afraid with their running here
and there and lowd crying one to another to pull at this and y<sup>t</sup>
rope."</p>

<p>These small emigrant ships of the seventeenth century, besides
men, women and children, brought over much livestock housed in
temporary pens and shelters built amidships. The long boat or
pinnace was also carried on board, all of which left little room for
movement about the deck. But these three hundred tons ships were
traveling palaces when compared with some of the smaller craft
that boldly ventured across the Atlantic. Barks, ketches, pinks and
other small vessels of less than fifty tons burden were common.
In 1635, a "small Norsey bark" of twenty-five tons reached Boston.
She was bound for Connecticut, but a stormy voyage had
forced her to seek safety in Boston harbor. This vessel, little over
thirty feet in length, brought over fourteen passengers, including
two women, with their household goods.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Their Early Shelters and Later Dwellings</span></h3>


<p>There is a widespread misconception that the colonists
on reaching Massachusetts proceeded immediately to build
log houses in which to live. Historians have described
these log houses as chinked with moss and clay and as having earth
floors, precisely the type of house built on the frontier and in the
logging camps at a much later period. A well-known picture of
Leyden Street, at Plymouth, shows a double row of log houses
reaching up the hillside, which the Pilgrims are supposed to have
constructed. In point of fact, no contemporary evidence has been
found that supports the present-day theory. The early accounts of
what took place in the days following the settlement along the
coast are full of interesting details relating to day-by-day happenings
but nowhere do we find allusion to a log house such as modern
historians assume existed at that time. This unique form of construction,
however, had been used in Scandinavia since the Middle
Ages and also in parts of Germany, but never did it appear in England.
It also is well established that the North American Indians
knew nothing of this method of construction, even the Iroquois
tribe who built a "long house," so-called.</p>

<p>The Swedes and Finns who settled in Delaware in 1638 introduced
the log house built of logs with notched ends, with which
they were familiar in their homeland. What more natural? Jasper
Dankers and Peter Sluyter, Dutch travelers, made a tour of the
American colonies in 1679-1680, and while passing through New
Jersey, describe the house of Jacob Hendricks, near the town of
Burlington, as follows:</p>

<p>"The house, although not much larger than where we were the
last night, was somewhat better and tighter, being made according
to the Swedish mode, and as they usually build their houses here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which are block-houses, being nothing less than entire trees, split
through the middle, or squared out of the rough, and placed in the
form of a square, upon each other, as high as they wish to have the
house; the ends of these timbers are let into each other, about a foot
from the ends, half of one into half of the other, the whole structure
is thus made without a nail or a spike. The ceiling and roof do
not exhibit much finer work, except amongst the most careful people,
who have the ceiling planked and a glass window. The doors
are wide enough, but very low, so that you have to stoop in entering.
These houses are quite tight and warm: but the chimney is
placed in a corner. My comrade and myself had some deer skins,
spread upon the floor to lie on, and we were, therefore, quite well
off and could get some rest."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>These travelers also spent a night at a Quaker's house near
where a gristmill had been erected on a creek above the falls at
what is now Trenton.</p>

<p>"Here we had to lodge: and although we were too tired to eat,
we had to remain sitting upright the whole night, not being able to
find room enough to lie upon the ground. We had a fire, however,
but the dwellings are so wretchedly constructed, that if you are not
close to the fire, as almost to burn yourself, you cannot keep warm,
for the wind blows through them everywhere. Most of the English
and many others, have their houses made of nothing but clapboards,
as they call them there, in this manner: they first make a
wooden frame, the same as they do in Westphalia, but not so
strong, they then split the boards of clapboard, so that they are like
cooper's pipe-staves, except they are not bent. These are made very
thin, with a large knife, so that the thickest edge is about a little
finger thick, and the other is made sharp, like the edge of a knife.
They are about five or six feet long, and are nailed on the outside
of the frame, with the ends lapped over each other. They are not
usually laid so close together, as to prevent you from sticking a
finger between them, in consequence either of their not being well
joined, or the boards being crooked. When it is cold and windy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
best people plaster them with clay. Such are most all the English
houses in the country."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The only type of log construction in use in New England in the
early days existed in garrison houses built as a protection against
the Indians. In every instance the logs were carefully hewed
square, to make a close fit against each other, and never notched at
the ends, sometimes halved at the corners of the structure, but
usually dove-tailed into each other at the ends in medieval military
manner. Several of these garrison houses still exist and although
afterwards used as dwellings, at first they were built as forts.</p>

<p>What happened at the Plymouth Colony after the <em>Mayflower</em>
came to anchor? The wind blew very hard for two days and the
next day, Saturday, December 23, 1620, as many as could went
ashore: "felled and carried timber, to provide themselves stuff for
building," and the following Monday "we went on shore, some to
fell timber, some to saw, some to rive, and some to carry; so no
man rested all that day."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Bradford writes "that they builte a
forte with good timber" which Isaac de Rasieres described in 1627
as "a large square house, made of thick sawn planks, stayed with
oak beams." The oldest existing houses in the Plymouth Colony are
built in the same manner and some half dozen or more seventeenth-century
plank houses may yet be seen north of Boston.
Moreover, when the ship <em>Fortune</em> sailed from Plymouth in the
summer of 1621, the larger part of her lading consisted of "clapboards
and wainscott," showing clearly that the colonists soon after
landing had dug saw pits and produced boards in quantity suitable
for the construction of houses and for exportation.</p>

<p>The first settlers in the Massachusetts Bay brought with them
mechanics of all kinds, well equipped with tools, and it is altogether
probable that these workmen plied their trades on this side of the
Atlantic exactly as they had been taught through long centuries of
apprenticeship in England. The houses of that early period, still
remaining, all resemble similar English structures. Upon arrival,
however, the need for shelter was imperative, and all sorts of rude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
expedients were adopted. Deacon Bartholomew Green, the printer
of the <cite>Boston News-Letter</cite>, related that when his father arrived
at Boston in 1630, "for lack of housing he was wont to find shelter
at night in an empty cask," and during the following winter many
of the poorer sort still continued to live in tents through lack of
better housing. When Roger Clap arrived at Charlestown in 1630
he "found some Wigwams and one House ... in the meantime
before they could build at Boston, they lived many of them in tents
and Wigwams."</p>

<p>John Winthrop, in his <cite>Journal</cite>, writes that "the poorer sort of
people (who lay long in tents) were much afflicted with scurvy and
many died, especially at Boston and Charlestown." He also makes
several references to English wigwams. In September, 1630, one
Fitch, of Watertown, had his wigwam burned down with all his
goods and two months later John Firman, also of Watertown, lost
his English wigwam.</p>

<p>Edward Johnson, in his <cite>Wonder-Working Providence</cite>, mentions
the rude shelters of the first settlers. "They kept off the short
showers from their lodgings, but the long rains penetrated through
to their disturbance in the night season, yet in those poor wigwams
they sang Psalms, praise and pray their God till they can provide
them homes which ordinarily was not wont to be with many till the
earth by the Lord's blessing brought forth bread to feed them,
their wives and little ones."</p>

<p>The Rev. Francis Higginson, in his <em>New-Englands Plantation</em>,
printed in 1630, describes the wigwams built by the Indians living
at Salem as "verie little and homely, but made with small poles
prick't into the ground and so bended and fastened at the tops and
on the side, they are matted with boughes and covered with sedge
and old mats." It seems likely that when the English built themselves
"English wigwams," they copied the small structures built
by the Indians, especially as mats suitable for covering might be
obtained from the Indians by barter, and old pieces of sailcloth
doubtless might be obtained from the shipping stores. It seems unlikely
that an Englishman living in one of these structures during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the winter season would be content to allow the smoke from his fire
to find its way out through a hole in the roof in the Indian fashion.
It is more likely that a fireplace, built of stones or bricks, would be
constructed at one end of an "English wigwam." A door in hewed
frame, with wooden hinges, probably was installed as a suitable
substitute for the Indian mat lifted upon entering. The floors in
these English wigwams undoubtedly would be covered with rushes
or straw, following the custom in English cottages at that time.</p>

<p>Edward Johnson, the town clerk of Woburn, writing in 1652,
relates of the first settlers that "after they have thus found out a
place of aboad, they burrow themselves in the Earth for their first
shelter under some Hill-side, casting the Earth aloft up on Timber:
they make a smoaky fire against the Earth at the highest side,
and thus these poore servants of Christ provide shelter for themselves,
their Wives and little ones."</p>

<p>Alonzo Lewis, the historian of Lynn, writing a century ago,
states that some of the first settlers in that town made shelters for
themselves and families by digging caves into the hillsides. On the
bank of the Connecticut River above Hartford, is the Loomis Institute,
on the grounds of which is the site where the men from
Dorchester, Mass., in 1635, constructed their first dwellings, which
were dug into the river bank. The bank itself composed three walls
of the shelter and the front was a framing of boards with a door
and a window. The roof was thatched with river sedge. The last of
these long abandoned dugouts was filled in as recently as 1926.</p>

<p>At Concord, Mass., the early settlers dug cellars in the earth
which they spanned with wooden spars and then covered with
turf. A more detailed description of such shelters is found in a
report made in 1650, by the Secretary of the Province of New
Netherlands:</p>

<p>"Those in New Netherlands and especially in New England
who have no means to build farmhouses at first, according to their
wishes, dig a square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, 6 or 7 feet
deep, as long and as broad as they think proper, case the earth inside
with wood all round the wall, and line the wood with bark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earth, floor
this cellar with plank and wainscott it overhead for a ceiling, raise a
roof of spars clear up and cover the spars with the bark or green
sods, so that they can live dry and warm in these houses with their
entire families for two, three or four years, it being understood
that partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to
the size of the family. The wealthy and principal men of New
England, in the beginning of the Colonies, commenced their first
dwelling houses in this fashion."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The frequent references to the English wigwam seem to indicate
that some such temporary construction was usual among many of
the colonists at the outset. Settlers were living at Salem as early as
1626 and Endecott, with a considerable immigration, arrived in
1628. Marblehead, just across the harbor, was settled early and
yet when John Goyt came there in 1637, he "first built a wigwam
and lived thar till he got a house."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The rude buildings also put up
by planters at Salem must have been looked upon at the time as
temporary structures for they had all disappeared before 1661.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>When Governor Winthrop arrived at Charlestown in 1630 with
the first great emigration, he found a house or two and several wigwams&mdash;rude
shelters patterned after the huts built by the Indians&mdash;and
until houses could be erected in Boston many lived in tents
and wigwams, "their meeting-place being abroad under a Tree."</p>

<p>In the summer of 1623, Bradford mentions the "building of
great houses in pleasant situations," and when a fire broke out in
November of the following year it began in "a shed yt was joyned
to ye end of ye storehouse, which was wattled up with bowes." It
will be seen that this shed was not crudely built of logs or slabs but
that its walls were wattled and perhaps also daubed with clay, in
precisely the same manner with which these colonists were familiar
in their former homes across the sea. An original outer wall in the
old Fairbanks house at Dedham, Massachusetts, still has its "wattle
and daub" constructed in 1637.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas Dudley writing to the Countess of Lincoln, in March,
1631, relates: "Wee have ordered that noe man shall build his
chimney with wood nor cover his house with thatch, which was
readily assented unto, for that divers houses have been burned
since our arrival (the fire always beginning in the wooden chimneys)
and some English wigwams which have taken fire in the
roofes with thatch or boughs."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It was Dudley who was taken to
task by the Governor in May, 1632, "for bestowing so much cost
on wainscotting his house and otherwise adorning it," as it was not
a good example for others in the beginning of a plantation. Dudley
replied that he had done it for warmth and that it was but clapboards
nailed to the walls. A few months later this house caught
fire "the hearth of the Hall chimney burning all night upon the
principal beam."</p>

<p>In 1631, John Winthrop entered in his <em>Journal</em> that the chimney
of Mr. Sharp's house in Boston took fire "the splinters being not
clayed at the top" and from it the thatch caught fire and the house
was burnt down.</p>

<p>The first meetinghouse built in Salem had a "catted" chimney,
that is, the chimney was built with sticks laid cobhouse fashion and
the whole daubed with clay inside and out.</p>

<p>Thatch as a roof covering was in common use in the early days.
Notwithstanding the Great and General Court forbade its use, it
still persisted as necessity arose. At the outset, towns along the
coastline set aside certain parts of thatch banks in the marshes, as a
supply for thatching houses. Rye straw also was much used. The
roofs of these thatched houses were not boarded as the thatch was
fastened to slats. Dorchester built a meetinghouse in 1632 with a
thatched roof.</p>

<p>The earliest frame houses were covered with weather-boarding
and this before long was covered with clapboards. The walls inside
were sheathed up with boards moulded at the edges in an ornamental
manner and the intervening space was filled with clay and
chopped straw, and later with imperfect bricks. This was done for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
warmth, and was known as "nogging," following the English practice.
When roofs were not thatched, they were covered with
shingles split from the log by means of a "frow" and afterwards
hand-shaved. The window openings were small and were closed by
hinged casements, just as the houses in England were equipped at
that time. Generally, the casement sash was wood, but sometimes
iron was used, as was common in England.</p>

<p>The glass was usually diamond-shaped, set in lead "cames."
Emigrants to Massachusetts were instructed by the Company to
bring ample supplies of glass for windows, but the supply ran short
and in the poorer cottages and wigwams, oiled paper was in common
use. This was an excellent substitute and supplied a surprisingly
large amount of light.</p>

<p>A brickyard was in operation in Salem as early as 1629, and
everywhere along the coast clay was found and made up into bricks.
Chimneys were built upon a huge stone foundation. The brick work
began at the first floor level and the bricks were laid in puddled
clay up to about the ridge line where lime was used as the chimney
top became exposed to the weather.</p>

<p>It has been claimed and denied that bricks used in the construction
of certain old houses were brought from overseas. In general
the claims may be disregarded. It is certain, however, that the
Massachusetts Company at the outset sent over ten thousand bricks,
stowed in the ballast with five chauldrons of sea coals for the use
of the blacksmiths. At the same time came iron and steel, nails, red
lead, salt and sailcloth. Even fourteen hundred weight of plaster
of paris, appears in the list, priced at eighteen shillings per hundred
weight.</p>

<p>The home of the average New Englander in the late seventeenth
century was a wooden dwelling of two stories built around a
brick chimney containing large fireplaces. In Rhode Island and in
parts of Connecticut, where shale abounded, the chimney was built
of stone and not infrequently the house, in whole or at one end,
was also so constructed. The roofs of these houses were covered
with wooden shingles usually split from pine logs and shaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
smooth by hand on a shingle horse. The outside walls of the well
made house were covered with clapboards, also smoothed on the
shingle horse. For many years these clapboards were made from
oak, but as this wood has a tendency to warp and pull itself free
from fastenings, by the year 1700, its use for that purpose had very
generally been replaced by pine. Outbuildings and the poorer class
of dwellings were not covered with clapboards or only the part
next the road, for the New Englander believes in "putting his best
foot forward." Such buildings were covered with "weatherboards"
or plain boarding that lapped at the lower edge.</p>

<p>The windows in these houses were filled by casement sash containing
glass set in lead cames. The glass was usually diamond
shaped, but sometimes four by six inch lights were used. This glass
was imported from England and came packed in cribs, but much of
it came in sheets already leaded and was cut to size by "glaziers"
upon demand. Early in the eighteenth century sliding-sash windows
were introduced, probably about 1710, but it was a long time
before existing casements were entirely given up. One Saturday
afternoon in July, 1714, lightning struck the house of Colonel
Vetch in Boston. He had bought the dwelling not long before and
Judge Sewall records in his diary that at the time of the storm "the
Work of Transformation was not finished" to make the building
fit for the occupancy of Madam Vetch. The lightning played various
tricks with the house, doing considerable damage, and among
other details the Judge mentions that it "lifted up the Sash Window
and broke one of the squares" of glass.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Colonel Vetch was
presumably a man of substance for he afterwards became Governor
of Nova Scotia, and he is likely to have "transformed" his recently
purchased house into the latest fashion of lighting.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Judge Sewall, the Chief Justice of the highest
court in the Province, had casements in his Boston house at a
time, ten years later, when his daughter Hannah died, for he records
in his <em>Diary</em> that "Boston will not have her put into the
Cellar [it was in August when she died]; so she is only remov'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
into the best Room. And because the Casements were opened for
Coolness, Boston would watch all night." This entry in the ancient
diary not only preserves the fact that the Judge's house had casement
windows, but it also makes allusion to the old-time custom of
watching with the dead body and the interest that the town of
Boston had in the bereavement of the Judge.</p>

<p>In 1722, Benjamin Franklin in his Boston newspaper, was satirizing
the extravagancies of New England housewives in "new
Glazing their Houses with new fashion'd square Glass." Diamond
glass had seen its day, however, and forty years later "Windows set
in lead, suitable for Hot-Beds" were advertised in the newspapers,
a sure sign of discarded sash. On the other hand, a hardware shop
was advertising "sheet and diamond glass" as late as 1766, probably
to meet the demands for repairing old casements.</p>

<p>The exterior of these early houses was seldom painted, in fact
it was well into the nineteenth century before the outside of houses
in country towns were usually painted. A diarist who rode into
Boston in 1804 comments on the dingy appearance of the houses
and the general lack of paint and about the same time a Salem man
met with success in business, whereupon he painted his house with
the result that his associates rather sneeringly remarked: "Sam is
feeling his oats; he's begun to paint his house."</p>

<p>The paint first used on the exteriors of New England houses
was usually of a dark red color called, both then and now, "Indian
red." Red ochre was used and commonly was mixed with fish oil.
The Indians had "paint mines" where they had found red earth
and doubtless these "mines" were utilized, particularly in adjacent
locations. One of these paint mines was located near what is now
Augusta, Maine, and in that part of New England formerly existed,
long before the coming of the European, an Indian race that
used this red earth so freely that by ethnologists it has been termed
the "red paint culture."</p>

<p>So runs the present-day tradition of Indian red in New England.
In point of fact, however, red earth was brought from the East
Indies long before the settlement of the American Colonies, hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the name "India red," by which it was advertised in the Boston
newspapers in the mid-eighteenth century. In 1766, John Gore, "at
his Shop at the Sign of the Painter's Arms in Queen Street," Boston,
advertised a stock of oils, paints, brushes, etc., just imported
from London. He had linseed oil by the barrel or smaller quantity,
boiled oil, nut oil, turpentine oil and turpentine varnish. Among
his white colors, were Spanish white and French halk,&mdash;whatever
that may be. Red was a color that was in demand for he carried red
head, Spanish brown, India red, purple red, Venetian red, Vermillian,
drop hake, carmine, umber and rose pink. Under yellows, he
listed King's yellow, Princess yellow, Naples yellow, spruce yellow,
stone yellow, English ochre, Orpiment-pale and deep, Dutch
pink and brown pink. The blues were ultramarine, ultramarine
ashes, Prussian blue of various sorts, calcined smalt, strowing ditto,
verditer blue and powder blue.</p>

<p>Gore also sold crayons in sets and canvas for portrait painting in
half-length cloths, kit-kat and three-quarters length. He carried
"Colours prepared for House and Ship Painting," best London
crown glass for pictures and "Water Colours ready prepared in
Shells."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Two years later he advertised chariot glasses, genteel looking-glasses
and Wilton carpets and also announced that he did coach
and carpet painting in the best and cheapest manner.</p>

<p>At how early a date was paint used on the exterior of a New
England house? Who can solve the problem? Undoubtedly it was
on a house owned by some merchant having a direct contact with
England. It is an established fact that the Andrews house, built in
1707-1710, in the country town of Topsfield, Mass., was painted
Indian red at the time it was built, or soon after, but only on the
trim&mdash;the window frames, corner boards, etc. The clapboards and
weather-boarding at the easterly end, remained unpainted until
long years after.</p>

<p>The inside finish of town houses owned by well-to-do people,
probably was painted at a comparatively early date, at least, one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
two rooms in a house. "A large Fashionable Dwelling-House" in
Boston, "about 1&#188; miles from Charlestown ferry" was advertised
to be sold in 1734. It had eight "fire rooms"&mdash;that is, rooms with
fireplaces. The entries and two of the rooms were "beautifully
Wainscotted and laid in oil" and four were "handsomely Painted."</p>

<p>In 1753, George Tilley, a Boston shop keeper, advertised his
house for sale. It contained "eight rooms, seven of them fire-rooms,
with a Number of convenient Closets and a good Cellar, four of
the said Rooms is cornish'd, and the House is handsomely painted
throughout; one of the Rooms is painted Green, another Blue, one
Cedar and one Marble; the other four a Lead colour, the Garrets
are handsomely plaistered; the House has twenty Sash-Windows
to it and is pleasantly situated on Pleasant Street, near the Hay-Market."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>But such glory did not exist in other parts of the same town and
certainly not in the country. Rufus Choate, the lawyer, was born in
a house in Essex, Mass., built in 1725 by an ancestor who was
popularly called "Governor Choate." He was a man in comfortable
circumstances and built for himself a house of ten rooms having
good panelling in four of them. None of the finish on this house
was painted until well after 1825 or a century after it was built.
This paint has now been removed and the old white pine finish is
revealed in all its natural beauty of varying shades of reddish
brown, effectively contrasting with the whitewashed walls. Natural
wood finish, laid in oil, was quite the common thing in the ordinary
New England dwelling, until after the people had recovered from
the financial exhaustion of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The plastered walls were usually whitewashed which was quite
in keeping with the Puritan character that covered with limewash
the beautiful mural decorations of the English churches at the time
of the Commonwealth. Families of wealth covered their walls
with hangings brought from England. Peter Sergeant died in 1714,
possessed of a "suit of Imagery Tapestry hangings" in his cedar
room. This house was one of the finest in the town of Boston and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
afterwards became the Province House,&mdash;the residence of the Governors
of the Province. Another room in this house was also furnished
with hangings. Arras hangings were advertised from time to
time in the Boston newspapers and in 1736, Boydell, the printer of
the <em>Boston Gazette</em>, advertised a house in which one chamber in
the first story was "hung with Scotch Tapestry, the other with
Green cheny." The large brick house of the late Isaac Gridley,
situated near Fort Hill, in Boston, was sold in 1771. It contained
thirteen rooms and three of the lower rooms were "genteelly furnished
with Tapestry Hangings."</p>

<p>A three-story house was built in Boston about 1715 by William
Clark, a wealthy merchant and member of the governor's council.
His death in 1742, was attributed by some, to the loss of forty sail
of vessels in the French War. In this house afterwards lived Sir
Henry Frankland, Collector of the Port, who fell in love with
Agnes Surriage, the beautiful sixteen-year-old maid-of-all-work
at the Fountain Inn in Marblehead. Her romantic story is well-known.
This house differed but little from the dozen or so of its
type to be found in Boston at the time, save in its rich and elaborate
decoration of the north parlor, at the right of the entrance hall.
Here, the walls were divided into panels by fluted pilasters supporting
an elaborate cornice, the whole heavily gilded, and each of
the panels was embellished with a landscape or other decoration
painted in oils. Painted arabesques and heraldic devices covered all
other flat surfaces and the floor was laid in a mosaic of various
colored woods. Every inch of the surface of this parlor was the
product of the imagination and skill of the painter, gilder or carver.
But while this magnificence actually existed in New England, by
no means was it typically representative of its culture or artistic
development. It merely exhibited the pride of wealth and was
largely the product of European craftsmen.</p>

<p>The heavy strap hinges on the doors of the earlier houses and
buildings were probably wrought by hand at the forge of the nearest
blacksmith, but most of the hardware and iron work was imported
from England. Before 1650 there was a slitting mill at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Saugus Iron Works, but the principal product of this forge was cast
iron manufactures, such as pots and kettles. At a later date, Parliament,
at the instigation of the English manufacturers, prohibited
by law the setting up of slitting mills and trip hammers, and it
naturally followed that the manufactured iron and brass required
by the Colonies was brought overseas from Birmingham and
Sheffield.</p>

<p>A word or two as to the varying types of house hardware may
not be amiss at this time. At the outset wooden hinges and heavy
strap hinges of wrought iron were in common use. These hinges
were hung on gudgeons and their points varied in design but the
spear-shaped point was most common. In the best houses, at an
early date and continuing until the beginning of the eighteenth
century, might be found the so-called "cock's head" hinge, an ornamental
survival from Roman times. The butterfly hinge was also in
use at that time&mdash;usually on cupboards and furniture doors. The
<strong>H</strong> and <strong>HL</strong> hinges came into use in New England in the early
1700's and lasted until after the Revolution. These hinges were
cut out of heavy sheet iron and were made in factories in England.
This type of hinge was superseded by the cast-iron butt, still in
use, which was invented in England in 1775, and adopted very
generally in the United States at the close of the Revolution.</p>

<p>In some old houses that have been restored and in many modern
constructions done in the manner of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, the door hinges in painted rooms have been picked out in
black making them most conspicuous. This is a modern conceit&mdash;an
invention of the modern architect. It was not done in the old
days, a fact easily established by carefully scraping through the
various coats of paint on an old house. Our great-great-grandmothers
had no itching desire for contrasts of that sort. They knew
nothing of highboys, grandfather's clocks, low daddys, Lady
Washington chairs, courting mirrors, fiddle back chairs or donkey-eared
spindle backs. These names are inventions of collectors or
antique dealers striving for the picturesque. The highboy, it is true,
antedates the others, but in the early days this piece of furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
was called a high chest of drawers and the lowboy was called a low
chest. Recently the common <strong>HL</strong> hinge has been described as the
"Holy Land" hinge; certainly not referring to the English colonies
where there were fully as many sinners as saints.</p>

<p>Wooden latches were used on both outside and inside doors in
early days and the wooden latch persisted in the back country until
comparatively recent times. The iron thumb latch was made by the
country blacksmith but more and more it came to be imported from
England. The earliest type has spear-point handles. The rounded
end comes in after 1700 and is common about 1750. The Norfolk
latch, in brass and iron, comes in after the Revolution and was replaced
by the common cast-iron thumb latch, invented by Blake in
1840. In examining old hinges and all kinds of hardware always
have in mind that the machine-made pointed screw was not invented
until 1846.</p>

<p>A feature of this hardware trade with England, which is of much
interest, is the catalogues that were sent over by the manufacturers
in Birmingham. About the year 1770 they began to send out drawings
of different pieces of hardware, tools, etc., and this soon developed
into sheets of engravings on copper which were bound into
books and sent to customers at a distance who then could visualize
the goods and order accordingly; size, list price and discount were
indicated. Seldom was there a title-page or even a label to indicate
a source, but the handmade paper bears its watermark and generally
the date when it was made. These catalogues are now difficult
to find and the Victoria and Albert Museum at South Kensington,
esteems them so highly that a descriptive catalogue of its collection
has been published. Probably the largest collection of these catalogues
in America is in the library of the Essex Institute at Salem.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">How They Furnished Their Houses</span></h3>


<p>It is a lamentable fact that the present generation possesses
little accurate information on the every day life and surroundings
of the early settlers in Massachusetts. Some of the
finer pieces of furniture have been preserved together with a few
portraits and pieces of silver and here and there an article of costume
of special beauty or unusual association. The newly settled
country had no artists to paint pictures of household interiors in
the manner of the Dutch painters and the diarists and letter writers
of that time when they used a quill pen, devoted little thought to
the homely happenings of the household or to the costume and
furniture with which every one was familiar. Judge Samuel Sewall's
diary<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> throws much light on New England life two centuries
and more ago, but many are the questions we would like to ask. In
August, 1702, he rode to Newbury to attend the funeral of his
sister Mehitable and returned home by way of Andover where he
found that the keeper of the ordinary was sick and so went to Mr.
Woodman's daughters "and there din'd on Pork and Beans; afterward
had Fowls rosted and dress'd very well." It would be interesting
if we could know more about that dinner. Did the Judge eat
in the same room in which the fowls were "rosted" and was the
table furnished with woodenware or pewter, or both? Had the
Woodmans begun to use two-tined forks or did the Judge hold the
meat in one hand while he cut it up and conveyed it to his mouth
with the knife? Was a roasting jack fastened over the fireplace?
Was the dinner served on a table-board? Did all stand while "a
blessing" was asked? What was served for dessert? Did the Judge
wash his hands at the washbench in the kitchen and if not, where
did he find the washbasin? What pictures were on the parlor walls
and was there a bedstead in the corner and if so, how was it furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and how made? A bedstead known to have been used in a
New England house of 1702 is almost unknown today. If the
Judge had only devoted five minutes, while writing up his diary,
to a close description of that bedstead and its furnishings he would
have settled many existing doubts.</p>

<p>It seems entirely reasonable that a distinguished guest in the
house would not be required in the morning to go to the washbench
in the kitchen and use the family basin. The dignity of Judge
Sewall and the delicacy of Madam Belcher would rebel at the
thought of an exhibition of disheveled attire before the serving
maid and the numerous children of the family. In the humblest
home, on occasion, it would be a simple matter to place in the
chamber of a guest, on a table or even on a chair, a basin and a jug
of water with a towel.</p>

<p>In the journal of the travels of Dr. Alexander Hamilton of
Annapolis, Md., who rode through New England in 1744, may be
found the description of the furnishings of a chamber in an inn.
Doctor Hamilton was accompanied by a negro servant and on a
Sunday morning at Marblehead he asked for his portmanteau. "I
was told by my man Dromo that it was in his room. I had the curiosity
to go and see what kind of a room his room was, and upon a
reconnoitre found it a most spacious one, furnished <em>a la mode de
Cabaret</em>, with tables, chairs, a fine feather-bed with quilted counterpane,
white calico canopy, or tester, and curtains, every way adapted
for a gentleman of his degree and complexion."</p>

<p>Of course 1744 is many years after the period when oak furniture
was commonly in use; yet Reid's tavern, "at the sign of the
Dragon," in the fishing village of Marblehead, could not have
been the resort of fashion or wealth and if a negro slave was given
so well furnished a chamber what may have been the furnishings
of the chamber occupied by Doctor Hamilton?</p>

<p>In a farmer's family, in the early days, it was undoubtedly the
habit to wash faces and hands in a small tub or keeler on the washbench
in the kitchen. In suitable weather it is altogether likely the
men of the family may have washed out of doors, beside the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
door, in a bucket of water freshly drawn from the well or brought
from the spring. The farm hands, on coming in from the fields, for
dinner, or at night, always "washed up" at a bench out of doors
and this custom persisted until well into the nineteenth century.
My mother, when young, for a time lived on a farm (about 1850)
and several times I have heard her describe the farm hand who
came to the back door one noon, and looking at his hands remarked,
"I guess they are clean enough," and so went into his dinner, without
washing.</p>

<p>Henry W. Erving of Hartford, Conn., writes: "A couple of
years ago I made a pilgrimage to my great-grandfather's former
home in Westford, Conn., in company with a kinsman over eighty
years old&mdash;the last of his generation. It was a very comfortable
house, with four rooms and a leanto, with a stone chimney. My
great-grandfather lived there as early as 1750. My cousin called
my attention to the old well near the door where, by the curb,
there was a large stone hollowed out like a trough. He said the
'men folks' as they came from the field, would fill that trough
with a bucket or two of water from which they would 'souse' themselves
thoroughly, thus not disturbing the goodwife. And of course
in the rustic neighborhoods the old customs existed long after they
were abandoned in the larger villages and towns.</p>

<p>"You will hardly believe, when I say it, but I distinctly remember
as a very small boy, going to a house in this same primitive town
of Westford where we were invited to dinner. The only drinking
vessel on the table was one of the quart Staffordshire mugs (would
that I had that mug in my collection today) which was filled with
water, milk or cider, I have really forgotten which, and passed
around the table at the demand of any thirsty one. The family
consisted of a man and his wife, an ancient grandmother, and several
children with not too clean faces. I couldn't refuse the mug
when urged upon me and selecting a place on the brim at the right
of the handle, I drank, when one of the children exclaimed, 'See,
mar! He's got granny's place.' Of course that practice in this instance
was possibly nearly a century out of period."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the standard examples of American humor is the picture
of the <em>Mayflower</em> loaded to the cross-trees with the chairs, chests
and cradles that devout New Englanders now own and claim were
brought over on that memorable voyage. It is so easy to attribute
age and romantic history to a treasured family relic that it has become
possible for a museum in the city of New York to exhibit a
punch bowl of Staffordshire ware, as a veritable relic of the <em>Mayflower</em>.
The bowl could not possibly have been made before 1780-1790.
There is another piece of Staffordshire treasured in the china
closet of a New England family, which the owner is certain was
formerly possessed by an ancestress who died years before the
Revolution. Well authenticated family tradition vouches for the
fact which cannot be disputed. Yet, the observer will soon discover
a steamboat pictured on one side of the pitcher and what is more
interesting, the stars and stripes are flying from the masthead and
the canton of the flag contains fifteen stars.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that some pieces of furniture were brought
over from England by the first settlers and the tradition connected
with such pieces can be authenticated by an examination of the chair
or chest showing that it is made of English and not American oak.
While most family possessions, for convenience in shipment, came
over in bales or bundles, covered with canvas in the true European
manner, a custom followed by emigrants of a later day, yet, many
articles of fine clothing and the treasured belongings of the better-equipped
families came over neatly stowed in chests and cupboards
and some of those chests have survived.</p>

<p>It is all a matter of common sense reasoning which can be backed
up by an examination of early records and also the furniture itself.
Why pay a considerable value in money to transport, in an overcrowded
ship, utilitarian pieces of furniture, that could be made in
the newly settled colony, by workmen who were going over in the
same ship? Timber could be had here for the cutting and until
sufficient time had elapsed to permit the making of chairs, beds and
other required furniture, one could sit on rudely made stools and
boxes and sleep on pallet beds made up on the floor just as many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
them would be obliged to sleep while on board ship.</p>

<p>Some estimate of the culture of the New England people during
the seventeenth century and of their appreciation of the refinements
of life may be reached with a degree of accuracy through a
study of the carefully itemized inventories of their estates made at
time of death. During that period the Royal Governor from overseas,
with his little court of officials and followers, had not introduced
London fashions and furnishings to the extent that existed
in the eighteenth century. Moreover, the wealth of the colonies
had not grown to the point where the refinements of life were not
only esteemed but demanded by loving spouses and by those who
had taken ship for England or the Continent and there had observed
how other people lived.</p>

<p>Among the early settlements made in the Colony of the Massachusetts
Bay was one at Agawam, now the town of Ipswich. The
news had reached Boston that the French were pushing their settlements
westward along the coast, bringing with them "divers
priests and Jesuits," which so alarmed the Governor and the Assistants
that it was decided to forestall the French and hasten the
planting of new towns north of Boston. The first move was to send
the Governor's son John, with twelve others, to establish themselves
at Agawam. There were no roads and so they sailed along
the coast in a shallop and took possession of the town site in March,
1633. Their families and other settlers soon followed and the increase
of population was such that in August, 1634, the Court of
Assistants decreed that the place be called Ipswich, after old Ipswich
in England, "in acknowledgment of the great honor and kindness
done to our people, who took shipping there."</p>

<p>Three months later, in November, 1634, one John Dillingham
arrived in Ipswich and the selectmen granted him six acres of land
on which to build a house. He was from Leicestershire and with his
wife and daughter had come over in the fleet with Winthrop in
1630, and remained in Boston until he removed to Ipswich. Life in
the frontier settlement was too severe for him and he died during
the next winter. On July 14, 1636, his widow, Sarah, made her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
"last will and testament" being in "perfect memory though my
body be weake &amp; sick" and a few days later she too was dead, leaving
her orphaned daughter to be cared for by Richard Saltonstall
and John Appleton, under the direction of the Quarterly Court.
And this was not at all difficult for John Dillingham had left a
"goodly estate," for the times. This Dillingham home has been
selected for analysis because it is one of the earliest estates in the
Colony of which we have exact and detailed information, a number
of documents relating to it having been preserved among the miscellaneous
papers in the Massachusetts State Archives.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Moreover,
it shows the furnishings and equipment of a settler living in a town
of only two years growth from the wilderness.</p>

<p>The Dillingham homestead consisted of a house of two rooms
and outbuildings with thirty acres of upland, sixty acres of meadow,
i.e., grass land, and six acres of planting ground near the house,
of which four acres were planted with corn. Apple trees and other
fruits were fenced off in the garden. For livestock there was a mare,
three cows, two steers, two heifers, four calves, and four pigs.
There was an indentured servant, Thomas Downs, to help cultivate
the land and care for the stock, and a maid, Ann Towle, who
not only helped with the housework but also worked in the fields.
"She hath been a faithful servant," wrote Richard Saltonstall, executor
of the estate, "and though she was discharged by her mistress
a little before her time was out, yet it may be borne by the
estate, considering her diligence." Ann had come over in the ship
<em>Susan and Ellen</em>, which arrived in April, 1635. Her passage cost &#163;5.</p>

<p>The Dillinghams occupied a good social position in the youthful
settlement but their two-room house did not contain any really fine
furniture. The parlor was also used as a bedroom, a practice which
was common everywhere in the seventeenth century. It had two
bedsteads valued at &#163;1. 6. 8.; a cupboard, 10s.; a sea chest, 10s.;
two "joyned Chaires," 5s.; a round table, 7s.; a deske, 4s.; and a
band box, 2s. There was also a large nest of boxes valued &#163;2. and
a small nest of boxes worth only three shillings. The feather beds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
boulsters, and pillows on each bed were valued at about twice as
much as a bedstead and the coverlets averaged about &#163;1. a piece.
There were flaxen sheets for Mrs. Dillingham's bed and coarse
sheets for the beds of the maid and the indentured servant. A
warming pan bears silent testimony to the cold of the winter season.
Another bedstead valued at only three shillings may have been in
the garret and occupied by Ann Towle, the maid. A chest stood in
the kitchen&mdash;more generally spoken of at that time as "the hall,"
in accordance with the English usage&mdash;and two boxes, probably
used for storage and also for seats. That was all the furniture listed
in the kitchen that was considered of any value. The tables, stools,
benches, shelving, or other furnishings seemingly necessary to
housekeeping at that time either did not exist or were so crude in
construction as to have little or no value in estimating the estate.
We find five cushions, however, valued at fifteen shillings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dillingham died possessed of a few really fine furnishings&mdash;possibly
treasured ancestral pieces&mdash;for she bequeathed a silver
bowl to the wife of Richard Saltonstall, and to the wife of John
Appleton she gave a silver porringer. It would be extremely interesting
today to know what has become of these two pieces of
Colonial silver. No other silver is mentioned but on shelving in the
kitchen rested 40&#189; pounds of pewter valued at &#163;2. 14. 0. As a
pewter plate of the time weighs nearly two pounds and a platter
much more the supply of pewter for the table was not large.
Wooden plates, trenchers, and bowls are not mentioned, but there
were twenty-five pewter saucers, six porringers, seven spoons, and
five shillings worth of knives. As for table forks, they were practically
unknown in the Colony at that time. Governor Winthrop
brought over a fork in 1630, carefully preserved in a case, which is
supposed to be the first and only table fork in the Colony in the
earliest days of the settlements. Knives, spoons, and fingers, with
plenty of napery, met the demands of table manners in the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>The large fireplace in the kitchen had its usual equipment of pot-hooks,
fire shovel and tongs, gridiron, trivet, and bellows, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
beside it was an old dark lantern valued at only two shillings.
There were iron pots, kettles, skillets and ladles; a brass pot and a
mortar. There was a frying-pan with a hole in it and in a box were
kept "bullets, hinges and other smale things." Two beer vessels
were listed; a case of bottles, two jugs, three pans, a tray, and two
baskets. Such was the simple equipment of the Dillingham kitchen.
There were plenty of table-cloths and napkins but no curtains at
any of the windows. If a broom were used it probably was made of
birch twigs bound together around a long handle. Candlesticks do
not appear in the inventory and the only store of food mentioned
(aside from twenty-one new cheeses valued at &#163;2. 16. 0.) was
seven bushels of rye, two firkins and a half of butter, a half bushel
of malt, six pounds of raisins, and some spice. Our ancestors had a
highly developed appreciation of the value of condiments. In a
Salem inventory at a somewhat later date appear salt, pepper,
ginger, cloves, mace, cinnamon, nutmegs, and allspice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dillingham's wearing apparel unfortunately is not listed
item by item, but given a total value of &#163;5. 8. 4. Her linen amounted
to an almost equal sum. Some of her deceased husband's clothing
is included in the inventory, such as a coat with silver buttons,
a red waistcoat, a suit of serge and a black suit of serge unmade, a
jacket of cloth, and an old suit and cloak. Little Sara Dillingham,
the orphaned child, when sent to school to goodwife Symonds was
supplied with "a stuffe petticoat &amp; waskote" and four "shifts with
shewes"; also a gown that cost &#163;2. 10s. Perhaps after a time she
may have been able to read and fully appreciate the books formerly
in her loving father's chest. They were: "Perkins works in 3 volumes,
Seaven Treatises bound in 2 volumes, the Spowse Royall, the
bruised reade, &amp; a little new testiment."</p>

<p>Six years later, in 1642, there died in the same town, Richard
Lumpkin, who had emigrated from Boxted, in Essex, and became
an influential citizen in the new town in the new county of Essex.
He was elected a representative to the Great and General Court
and was deacon of the Ipswich church at the time of his death. He
left an estate valued at &#163;300. In the hall of his house stood a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
table, with two forms and a stool beside it, having a total value of
only fifteen shillings. The hall also contained three chairs and six
cushions valued at four shillings. That was all the furniture in the
room that was of any value. There were books, however, valued at
&#163;2. 10. 0., a musket and a fowling piece and other small furnishings.
In the parlor was a table with six joined stools, three chairs
and eight cushions, a bedstead, and a trundle bed with curtains, and
a chest, the latter valued at only four shillings. In the chamber
over the parlor was a bedstead with its trundle bed, a table valued
at three shillings, four chests and two boxes; not a chair or stool is
named in connection with the room. The kitchen was in the leanto
and while it contained a good supply of brass and iron pots and
kettles and also pewter dishes, the table, bench, stools and wooden
plates, etc., that must have been in the room were of so little value
that they do not appear in the inventory.</p>

<p>It is when we meet with joined and wainscot chests and court,
livery, and standing cupboards that we find pieces that may have
been brought from overseas. When Mr. Thomas Millard of Newbury
(note the title of honor), died in 1653, he possessed a wainscot
cupboard, table, chairs and stools. He also left behind him
three silver spoons, a silver cup, and a silver salt seller, and among
the kitchen utensils were tinned pudding pans, a brazen chaffing
dish and a lanthorn and lamp made of latin ware.</p>

<p>The widow of the Rev. Jose Glover married, in 1641, Henry
Dunster, President of Harvard College. Among the furnishings
of her house were "eleven featherbeds or downe ... one of them
haveing philop and Cheny curtaines in graine with a deep silke
fringe on the vallance, and a smaller on the Curtaines, and a Coverlett
sutable to it, made of Red Kersie, and laced with a greene

<p>By way of contrast let us glance at the inventory of the possessions
of William Googe of Lynn, who died in 1646, ten years
after Mrs. Dillingham had willed that her body be "decently
buyried" and her child "religiously educated if God give it life."
Googe left a house and twelve acres of land and the total value of
his possessions amounted to but &#163;28. 11. 7, with debts of &#163;4. 9. 7.
He left a widow and three small children, and though dying in
very lowly circumstances he may have known better times, for
John Mascoll, the servant of Mr. Googe of Lynn, was fined in
1643, for neglecting the watch. The title of honor, "Mr.," was
used but sparingly in those early days and usually indicated a
degree of social standing in the community.</p>

<p>Googe had been a soldier, for among his personal belongings at
death were a sword and belt, a musket and bandoleers, and also
gunpowder. One cow and four hogs comprised his entire livestock,
and five bushels of wheat, ten bushels of Indian corn, and flax in
the bundle lay in the garret of his house, which was frugally furnished
with a chest, a chair, an old chair, a stool, and a trunk. The
family probably slept on pallet beds made up on the floor, for bedding
is listed but no bedsteads. They had a frying pan, a gridiron,
a skillet, a posnet, an earthen pot, six spoons, and the following
woodenware, viz.: "3 wood trayes &amp; 3 wood boules &amp; 3 wood
dishes, 1s. 9d.; one runlitt, 1s.; paieles &amp; tubs, 3s." Two bags
valued at two shillings bring to a close the list of the earthly possessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of William Googe of Lynn. When the inventory was brought
into court it very properly gave the goods to the widow "for the
bringing up of her three small children." So reads the record.</p>

<p>Doubtless there were many families in the Colony little better
conditioned, judging from the relatively small number of estates
settled through the courts when compared with the deaths and
estimated population.</p>

<p>Googe's house and twelve acres of land were valued at only &#163;8.
This must have been a very simple, thatch-roofed house of not
more than two rooms, comparable with the outlying farmhouse of
Jacob Perkins that was burned in Ipswich in 1668. And thereby
hangs a tale. Master Perkins and his wife had gone to town one
summer afternoon leaving the house in charge of Mehitable Brabrooke,
a sixteen-year-old serving maid. We will let the ancient
document in the court files relate what happened.</p>

<p>"About 2 or 3 aclocke in the afternoone she was taking tobacco
in a pipe and went out of the house with her pipe and gott upon
the oven on the outside &amp; backside of the house (to looke if there
were any hogs in the corne) and she layed her right hand upon the
thatch of the house (to stay herselfe) and with her left hand
knocked out her pipe over her right arme upon the thatch on the
eaves of the house (not thinking there had been any fire in the
pipe) and imediately went downe into the corne feild to drive out
the hogs she saw in it, and as she was going toward the railes of the
feild ... she looked back, and saw a smoke upon her Mistress'
house in the place where she had knocked out her pipe at which
shee was much frighted."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The wife of a neighbor came running to the assistance of Mehitable
and afterwards testified that when she reached the house she
looked into both fireplaces and saw no appearance of fire, only a
few brands nearly dead under a great kettle hanging in the chimney.
She also looked up into the chamber through the floor boards
that lay very open on the side where the smoke was.</p>

<p>Could photographs more vividly picture the scene? The thatch-roofed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
farmhouse had two rooms on the ground floor and a chimney
with two fireplaces. An oven was built on the backside probably
having an opening inside the kitchen fireplace in the usual manner.
The house was of but one story judging from the low roof that the
maid was able to reach when standing on the oven, and the floor of
the chamber in the loft had wide cracks between the boards so that
it was possible to look through from below and see the under side
of the roof. In similar homes lived many a family in the early days
in comparative comfort.</p>

<p>As for the careless Mehitable, she was brought before the Quarterly
Court on suspicion of wilfully setting the house on fire; a
serious offence, which as late as 1821, was the cause of the execution
in Salem of a sixteen-year-old boy. Among those who deposed
at her trial was a young man who said that as he and she were going
into the meadow, before the fire, to make hay, she told him that
her mistress was angry with her, but she had "fitted her now" for
she had put a great toad into her kettle of milk. As it turned out the
Court ordered Mehitable to be severely whipped and to pay &#163;40
damages to her master Jacob Perkins. It now seems incredible that
a serving maid of 1668 could ever get together so large a sum of
money.</p>

<p>The settlers in the New England Colonies, unless persons of
wealth or possessed of large families, during the early years lived
generally in houses having but one room and an entry-way on the
ground floor. Above would be a chamber&mdash;sometimes only a garret.
As the family increased in size and became more prosperous another
room would be added to the house on the other side of the
entry and chimney, making the structure a so-called two-room
house. Still later, with the need for more room, a leanto would be
built on the back of the house, thereby supplying three additional
rooms on the ground floor with a kitchen in the middle. The earlier
kitchen would then become a living-room or "sitting room"&mdash;in the
New England phrase. This earlier kitchen was usually called "the
hall" during the seventeenth century and in it centered the life of
the family. It was the room where the food was cooked and eaten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
There the family sat and there the indoor work was carried on. A
loom sometimes occupied considerable space near a window and
frequently a bed was made up in a corner, on which the father of
the family slept, and there sometimes also he died.</p>

<p>The principal feature of this common room was its huge fireplace
in which hung pots and kettles suspended by means of pot
chains and trammels from the hardwood trammel-bar or lug-pole
that rested on wooden cross bars and so bisected the wide flue in the
chimney. These large fireplaces in the early days were sometimes
called "chimneys" in the vernacular of the time. They were generally
as wide as eight feet and a ten foot opening is not unknown.</p>

<p>This cavernous opening was spanned by a wooden lintel&mdash;a stick
of timber sometimes sixteen inches or more square, and when exposed
to a roaring fire, piled high with logs, this became an element
of danger, the charring wood smoldering all night and setting
fire to the house. The trammel-bar in the flue also caught fire not
infrequently and gave way, allowing the pots and kettles to fall
to the hearth, bringing disaster to the dinner or to the curdling milk
and sometimes to those seated near. A trammel stick in the house
of Captain Denney gave way from this cause and a large kettle
filled with wort<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> fell down and spilt the boiling liquid over four
of his children who were sitting or lying on the hearth, some of
them asleep, "which scalded them in so terrible a manner, that one
died presently after, and another's life is dispaired of" continues
the record.</p>

<p>"Here is good living for those who love good fires," wrote Higginson
in his <cite>New-Englands Plantation</cite>, and under the spell of the
glowing flames, the bare, whitewashed walls, the brown timbers
and floor boards of the ceiling, the dress of pewter, and the simple
furnishings of the room, enriched by the shadows, became a place
full of cheer&mdash;a place where privation and homesickness might be
forgotten in the glow of the bright firelight. On cold nights the
short bench inside the fireplace was a chosen place and the settle, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
long seat made of boards with a high back to keep off the draft, was
drawn before the fire and here sat the older members of the family.</p>

<p>The larger kettles hanging in the fireplace, were of brass and
copper and some of them were of prodigious size. Hot water was
always to be had and these kettles also served for the daily cooking,
the cheese-making, soap-boiling, and candle-dipping.</p>

<p>Much of the food of the average New Englander until comparatively
recent times consisted of corn-meal, boiled meats and
vegetables and stews. Every well-equipped household had its spits
for roasting and many had gridirons, but the usual diet of the
average family was "hasty pudding"&mdash;cornmeal mush and milk&mdash;varied
by boiled meat or fish served in the center of a large pewter
platter and surrounded by boiled vegetables. Baked beans and
stewed beans appeared on the table several times every week in
the year. Indian bannock, made by mixing corn meal with water
and spreading it an inch thick on a small board placed at an incline
before the fire and so baked, was a common form of bread. When
mixed with rye meal it became brown bread and was baked in the
brick oven with the beans and peas.</p>

<p>The brick oven was a feature of every chimney. Sometimes in
early days it was built partly outside the house but so far as known
the opening was always in the kitchen fireplace. To reach it the
housewife must stoop below the oaken lintel and stand inside the
fireplace, taking care that her woolen skirts did not come near the
flames. To heat it for a baking, a fire was built inside, usually with
specially prepared pine or birch wood that had been split and seasoned
out of doors for a short time and then housed. The fire and
ashes were then taken out by means of a peel&mdash;a long-handled, flat-bladed
shovel made for the purpose&mdash;and when dusted out with a
broom made of hemlock twigs it was ready for the brown bread,
beans, peas, Indian pudding, pies, and rye drop cakes which were
made with rye meal, eggs and milk and baked directly on the bricks
in the bottom of the oven.</p>

<p>Between the years of 1635 and 1655, court records and inventories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of estates in the Massachusetts Bay Colony mention the following
articles of food:</p>

<p>Bacon, beef, butter, cheese, eggs, fowls, lamb, milk, mutton,
pork, suet, veal, wild game, and cod, herring, mackerel, salmon
and sturgeon.</p>

<p>Barley, beans, Indian beans, bran, cabbages, carrots, chaff, corn,
English corn, Indian corn, hops, Indian meal, rye meal, oatmeal,
oats, parsnips, peas, pumpions, rye, squashes, turnips and wheat.</p>

<p>Apples, berries, fruit, honey, raisins, sugar and vinegar.</p>

<p>Biscuit, blewlman, bread, cake, malt, salad oil, porridge, rye
malt, yeast, salt and many kinds of spices.</p>

<p>Much of this food was raised on the farm and nearly every
family had its garden. Such articles of food as were imported were
usually obtained at the shops in the larger towns by barter, as
money was scarce. In 1651, a farmer came through the woods to
Salem in his cart bringing twelve bushels of rye. He stopped at a
shop owned by George Corwin and from the daybook kept at the
time and still carefully preserved, we learn that among other necessaries
he carried home sugar for the goodwife, and for the children
a doll and a bird whistle.</p>

<p>In the early years domestic animals were too valuable to be killed
for meat but game was plentiful and was roasted by being trussed
on iron spits resting on curved brackets on the backs of the andirons.
This, of course, required constant turning to expose the roast on all
sides in order to cook it evenly&mdash;a task frequently delegated to a
child. A skillet would be placed beneath to catch the drippings.
Sometimes a bird was suspended before the fire by a twisted cord
that would slowly unwind and partly wind again, requiring some
one in frequent attendance to twist the cord. Families of wealth
possessed a "jack" to turn the spit. This was a mechanism fastened
over the fireplace and connected with the spit by means of a pulley
and cord. A heavy weight suspended by a cord which slowly unwound,
supplied the power that turned the spit.</p>

<p>In "the hall," usually upon open shelves, but sometimes upon a
dresser, was displayed the pride of the housewife&mdash;the dress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
pewter and latten ware. "China dishes," imported by the East India
Company or made in Holland, were used sparingly during the
early years of the colonies. There was much earthenware and stoneware
bottles and jugs, but it was wooden ware and pewter that were
commonly used. When Lionel Chute died in 1645 he bequeathed
his silver spoon to his son James.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It was the only piece of silver in
the house. Of pewter he died possessed of fourteen dishes "small
and great," eleven pewter salts, saucers and porringers, two pewter
candlesticks and a pewter bottle. The widow Rebecca Bacon who
died in Salem in 1655, left an estate of &#163;195. 8. 6., which included
a well-furnished house. She had brass pots, skillets, candlesticks,
skimmers, a little brass pan, and an excellent supply of pewter including
"3 large pewter platters, 3 a size lesse, 3 more a size lesse,
3 more a size lesse," having a total value of &#163;1.16. She also had a
pewter basin, six large pewter plates, and six lesser, nineteen pewter
saucers, two fruit dishes, an old basin and a great plate, two candlesticks,
one large salt and a small one, two porringers, a great
flagon, one lesser, one quart, two pints and a half pint; and an old
porringer. She also left "1 silver duble salt, 6 silver spoones, wine
cup &amp; a dram cup of silver."</p>

<p>Giles Badger of Newbury left to his young widow, a glass bowl,
beaker, and jug valued at three shillings; three silver spoons valued
at &#163;1, and a good assortment of pewter, including "a salt seller,
a tunell and a great dowruff." The household was also furnished
with six wooden dishes and two wooden platters. In other inventories
appear unusual items such as a pewter brim basin, pewter
cullenders, pewter beer cups, pans, and mustard pots. Pewter tankards
were common. There were new and old fashioned candlesticks.
Pewter salts came in three sizes and the saucers were both small
and large. In 1693, best London pewter plates cost the Boston
shopkeepers 9&#189; pence per pound in quantity.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century "hall" must have had little spare room
for its daily occupants, for in addition to its table and chairs, its
settle, stools and washbench, the long ago inventories disclose such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
chattels as powdering tubs in which the salted meats were kept, the
churn, barrels containing a great variety of things, keelers and
buckets, bucking tubs for washing, and the various implements used
in spinning and weaving, washing and ironing, cooking and brewing,
and the making of butter and cheese. In the chimney hung
hams and bacon and suspended from the ceiling were strings of
dried apples and hands of seed corn.</p>

<p>It is claimed by some that the floors were sanded. That certainly
was true at a later period but there are strong elements of doubt as
to the prevalence of this custom during the seventeenth century.
Sand, however, was used freely with home-made soft soap, to scrub
the floors which were always kept white and clean, and whenever
an early house is restored or taken down sand is always found,
sometimes in considerable quantity, where it has sifted down
through the cracks between the floor boards. The downstairs rooms
had double floors but the chamber floors were made of one thickness
of boards with here and there a knothole and frequently with
cracks between the boards through which the dust and dirt from
above must have sifted down upon the heads of those seated at
dinner or engaged in their daily tasks in the rooms below. Not
only does the structural evidence show this to be true but a number
of instances occur among the papers in Court files, where witnesses
have deposed as to what they had seen and heard through the cracks
in chamber floors. A grandson of Governor Endecott once fell a
victim of two gossiping sixteen-year-old girls who had spent some
time on their knees peeping through the cracks in a chamber floor.
Capt. Richard More, the last survivor of the company on the <em>Mayflower</em>,
late in life kept a tavern in Salem. He was spied upon in
this manner and eventually brought before the justices of the Quarterly
Court to answer for his evasion of the law set forth and
maintained at that time.</p>

<p>The parlor, called "the foreroom" at a later time, was the room
where guests of station were received. The best bed hung with curtains
and valance and covered with a rug, stood in a corner. In
those days rugs were not used on floors but as bed furnishings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Even the baby's cradle had its rug. Carpets, likewise, were too fine
for wooden floors and were used as table covers. Of bedsteads there
were many kinds&mdash;high and low, canopy, close, corded, half-headed,
joined, side, standing, inlaid, and wainscot, and slipped
under the higher bedsteads during the daytime, were trundle or
"truckle" beds in which the children slept at night. Lionel Chute,
the schoolmaster, had an "old darnkell coverlet" on his bed while
some of his neighbors possessed branched and embroidered coverlets
and several had coverlets made of tapestry.</p>

<p>Among the better families the parlor and chamber windows had
curtains hung from rods or cords. In the parlor stood chests in
which were stored the family clothing and bedding, for closets did
not exist in the seventeenth century house. There were great chests
and small chests, long boarded and great boarded chests, chests
with a drawer, carved chests, wainscot chests, trunks, and boxes. A
few stools and chairs, a looking-glass, a small table, and perhaps
a cupboard completed the furnishings of the well-supplied parlor.
In Capt. George Corwin's best room there were chairs with leather
bottoms and straw bottoms, a clock valued at &#163;2, a screen having
five leaves, a napkin press, and a "Scriture or Spice box." White
calico curtains hung at his chamber windows and the maid had a
"Calico Cuberd cloth" in her room. Parlor walls were whitewashed
and bare of ornament. The first families owned a portrait or two in
oils and here and there a map in unglazed frame decorated a wall.
The Puritan character did not warm to the fine arts and austere
living was the aim if not always the achievement of the time.</p>

<p>The chambers in the second story must have been curiously furnished
rooms, containing a huddle of stores of all descriptions.
Henry Short, the town clerk of Newbury, died in 1673 leaving a
goodly estate valued at nearly &#163;2,000.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He owned a negro slave
and his house was large and well furnished. There was an old
parlor and a new parlor containing beds, chests, chairs, trunks, and
boxes. In the chamber over the new parlor there was a good feather-bed
and bed clothing but no bedstead. Wool and yarn were stored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in this room together with boxes, tubs, some feathers, and miscellaneous
"lumber"&mdash;the phrase of the period for odds and ends.
The chamber over the kitchen, a comfortable room of course, in
winter, had its bed and bedding, also "5 hogsheds, 6 barrels, 5 Iron
hoopes, a pair of stockcards, meale trough &amp; other lumber, a parcell
of old Iron, a pike, a bed cord &amp; other cordage." Small wonder in
such a clutter that the rooms frequently had other tenantry than
the human occupants.</p>

<p>When Jasper Dankers arrived in Boston in 1680, the captain of
the packet took him to his sister's house where he lodged. "We
were taken to a fine large chamber," he writes, "but we were hardly
in bed before we were shockingly bitten. I did not know the cause,
but was not able to sleep.... My comrade who was very sleepy,
fell asleep at first. He tumbled about very much; but I did not
sleep any the whole night. In the morning we saw how it was, and
were astonished we should find such a room with such a lady."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Early in the eighteenth century the walls of rooms in some
Massachusetts houses began to be covered with "painted paper"
hangings imported from England. These <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier paints</i> were first
introduced into England, from France, about 1634, and probably
were brought into New England by Governor Andros and his followers.
Michael Perry, a Boston bookseller, who died in 1700, had
in his stock "7 quires of painted paper and three reams of painted
paper." His successor, Daniel Henchman, dealt in painted papers
as appears from his account books commencing in 1712. In 1713
two quires of painted paper cost four shillings, and two quires of
blue paper, three shillings. In 1714, Isaac Thomas of Pembroke
paid &#163;2. 10. 0 for "6 Rowls Paint'd Pap'r &amp; 2 Q'r Paper."</p>

<p>When Peter Sergeant of Boston died in 1714, the inventory of
his estate disclosed "one large gilt looking glass, in the cedar room,
&#163;5. One suit of Imagery Tapestry hanging, &#163;20. One suit of red
china &#163;5." Two years later the house was purchased by the Provincial
Government for a governor's residence and in 1741 we find
the Provincial Treasurer paying Daniel Henchman &#163;5. 8. 0. for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
four rolls of painted paper and shortly another bill was presented
for "New Tacking the paper hanging above in the chamber &amp; new
papering one roome below stairs."</p>

<p>In 1734, John Maverick, shopkeeper, bought of Henchman,
four quires and five sheets of painted paper for &#163;1. 3. 9. In 1736,
Colonel Estes Hatch bought 10 rolls painted paper for &#163;16. 5. 0.
which was probably used in his mansion in Dorchester, bought after
the Revolution by Colonel James Swan.</p>

<p>The painted paper of the eighteenth century was sold at first in
sheets, 22 by 32 inches, called elephant size. Later these were pasted
together to make 12 yard lengths. In the earlier stages of manufacture
the designs were colored by hand. Stencils of pasteboard
were used, and in the last half of the eighteenth century blocks of
pear and sycamore wood were used, as in calico printing. One who
painted coats of arms and other things pertaining to heraldry, as
well as one who painted or stained linen cloth, was known as a
"painter stainer." So, also, those who stained colored or stamped
paper for hangings were known as "paper stainers."</p>

<p>When Thomas Hancock built his house on Beacon Hill he desired
painted paper for some of his rooms. Extracts from his letter
to John Rowe, stationer, London, explain his wants:</p>

<p>"Sir: Inclosed you have the Dimensions of a Room for a shaded
Hanging to be Done after the same Pattern I have sent per Capt.
Tanner. The pattern is all that was left of a Room lately come over
here, and it takes much in ye Town and will be the only paper-hanging
for sale here which am of opinion may Answer well....
If they can make it more beautiful by adding more Birds flying
here and there, with some Landskips at the Bottom, Should like it
well. Let the Ground be the same colour of the Pattern. At the
top and bottom was a narrow Border of about 2 inches wide which
would have to mine....</p>

<p>"A hanging done much handsomer sent over three or four years
previous was made by Dunbar in Aldermanbury....</p>

<p>"In other of these Hangings are great variety of different Sorts
of Birds, Peacocks, Macoys, Squirrill, Monkys, Fruit and Flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
etc.... I think they are handsomer and better than Painted hangings
done in Oyle so I beg your particular Care in procuring this
for me and that the patterns may be taken care off and Return'd
with my Goods."&mdash;<em>Letter of Thomas Hancock to John Rowe, Stationer,
in London</em>, Jan. 23, 1737/8.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth-century Boston newspapers may be found
numerous items showing the use of wall paper and the fact that it
frequently was imported from England. But while it is true that it
could be purchased in the shops in Boston it does not follow that
rooms in every house were papered. Nor is it likely that the rooms
of houses in the country had papered walls save when the owner
was a wealthy man. London fashions would first be found transplanted
into the seaport towns and later would be adopted by the
country. Undoubtedly the home of the Governor, or of some well-to-do
sea captain, was the first house to be so decorated. On September
22, 1762, died Daniel Starr of Boston, "who has been for
many years employed in Papering Rooms." This item appears in
the news items of the <cite>Boston News-Letter</cite>. Eight years later the
same newspaper prints the following advertisement:</p>

<p>"George Killcup, jun. Informs the Gentlemen and Ladies in
Town and Country That he Paints Carpets &amp; other Articles, and
Paper Rooms in the neatest manner. He will take English or West
India Goods as Pay.</p>

<p>"Said Killcup is ready to pay those he is indebted to, in Painting
or Papering Rooms."&mdash;<cite>Boston News-Letter</cite>, March 17, 1768.</p>

<p>J. Boydell, the printer of the <cite>Boston Gazette</cite>, advertised in

<p>Against the earlier background of whitewashed walls hung few
decorations. Between 1635 and 1681 there were 960 estates probated
in Essex County, Massachusetts. The county had several seaport
towns and its inhabitants were more prosperous than many
other parts of the Colony. In the inventories of these 960 estates,
pictures are listed but eight times and maps were found in but
three homes. William Hollingsworth, the shipbuilder and merchant
of Salem, possessed seven framed pictures. They are the only
<em>framed</em> pictures mentioned. Hilliard Veren of Salem, who died in
1668, had three pictures in his hall chamber and Robert Gray of
the same town had in his parlor a large looking-glass with some
earthen dishes and a picture, the whole valued at &#163;2. The Rev.
Nathaniel Rogers of Ipswich, had two pictures in his parlor and
Thomas Wells of Ipswich, bequeathed to his son Thomas, the new
pictures of the King and Queen and the one of the "five sencces."
He also possessed maps and paper pictures.</p>

<p>Fifty years later John Smibert, the portrait painter, had his shop
"at his House in Queen Street, between the Town House and the
Orange Tree, Boston," where he sold "all sorts of Colours, dry or
ground with Oyls and Brushes, Fans of several sorts, the best
Mezotints, Italian, French, Dutch and English Prints, in Frames
and Glasses or without, by Wholesale or Retail, at Reasonable
Rates." About the same time the "Royal Waxwork" was to be seen
at the House of Mr. Thomas Brooks, shopkeeper, near the Draw
Bridge, and Thomas White, the engraver, was living in a house not
far away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Counterpanes and Coverlets</span></h3>


<p>In the early days our forefathers were dependent upon the
open fireplace and during the winter season everyone must
wear thick clothing and provide an ample supply of warm coverings
for the beds. Those were the days of warming pans and
heated bricks taken to bed by both children and grown-ups, and of
feather beds, comforters and patchwork quilts.</p>

<p>Bed coverings in the olden times, and even in our day, have a
variety of names with distinctions sometimes difficult to classify.
Sometimes they are counterpanes, and again coverlets. A <em>comforter</em>
suggests warmth and comfort not only for the bed but for the neck.
The <em>bed cover</em> is universal as is the <em>quilt</em>.</p>

<p>The patchwork quilt was formerly one of the most familiar and
necessary articles of household furnishing and its origin reaches
backward into the dim and unknown past. It was brought to the
Massachusetts Bay by the first settlers. In cottage and castle it was
known in the days of King John, and down through the generations
its making supplied occupation and amusement to countless women
whose life interests centered in their homes and household furnishings.
Its manufacture may well be styled one of the household
arts, for artistic indeed are the bold conceptions of many of the designs;
while the piecing and the patching provide ample opportunity
for needlework of the finest character.</p>

<p>In the early days the English spelled quilt with a final <em>e</em>&mdash;quilte&mdash;as
did the French. It is a cover or coverlet made by stitching together
two thicknesses of a fabric with some soft substance between
them. This applies to bed covers and also to quilted petticoats so
commonly worn in the old days.</p>

<p>What is a coverlet? Originally, any covering for a bed; now,
specifically, the outer covering. The word comes from the French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couvre-lit</i>&mdash;a bed covering. The handwoven coverlets of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
beautiful designs, in blue and white and red and brown, are well
known and formerly were woven everywhere.</p>

<p>The <em>counter-pane</em>, formerly a bed cover, now describes a light
coverlet woven of cotton with raised figures. The word is a corruption
of <em>counterpoint</em>, in allusion to the panes or squares of which
bed covers are often composed. The counterpane was never quilted.</p>

<p>The <em>bedspread</em> and the <em>bed cover</em> may be considered as one and
the same&mdash;the uppermost covering of a bed and accordingly of an
ornamental character in general. The <em>comforter</em> was a thickly quilted
bed cover made of several thicknesses of sheet cotton or wool
prepared for the purpose. This was too thick to be quilted so it was
knotted at regular intervals to prevent the interlining from slipping
out of place. Frequently it was called a "comfort."</p>

<p>There is one other name that was applied to a bed covering in
the Colonial times but which is never heard today in that connection.
In the days immediately following the settlement many a
New England bed was covered with a <em>rug</em>. When William Clarke
of Salem died in 1647, in the parlor of his house was a bed with a
green rug covering it which was valued by the appraisers at fourteen
shillings. The term was commonly in use at the time, in fact,
as commonly as the word coverlet. In the probate of Essex County,
Massachusetts, estates between the years 1635 and 1674, coverlets
are mentioned one hundred and forty-two times and rugs one hundred
and fifty-seven times while quilts are listed only four times.
These early bed rugs were usually thick woolen coverings with a
shaggy nap.</p>

<p>A never-failing source of accurate information as to the furnishings
and equipment of the New England household in the olden
time is the probate records&mdash;specifically, the inventory of the property
taken in connection with the settlement of the estate. For many
years it was the well-nigh universal custom to list, room by room,
the contents of a house and from these painstaking inventories it
now becomes possible to reconstruct in mental picture the interiors
of those homes where lived and died our Puritan ancestors. In connection
with the present subject we learn from these inventories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that it was quite the usual habit to set up a bed in the parlor and we
also learn of the existence of different kinds of rugs used in the bed
furnishings&mdash;cotton rugs, English rugs, Irish rugs, cradle rugs, etc.
There were worsted coverlets, tapestry coverlets and embroidered
coverlets. A darnacle coverlet is listed in 1665; but as darnacle curtains
appear in the same inventory it is safe to assume that darnacle
is the name of some long-forgotten fabric. But what is a "branched
coverlet?" Mrs. Thomas Newhall of Lynn possessed in 1674 a
green rug and a branched coverlet.</p>

<p>Capt. George Corwin of Salem who died in 1684, had a calico
counterpane in the red chamber in his house. In the corner chamber
was a green counterpane and in the kitchen chamber was a sad
colored counterpane, two coverlets, and a quilt of colored and
flowered calico.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at a few of these wills and inventories. In
1640, the widow Bethia Cartwright of Salem, bequeathed to her
sister, then living in England, her bed, bolster, blanket and coverlet.
It is an open question if the value of the property equalled the
probable cost of transporting it to that loving sister in distant England.</p>

<p>Mrs. Joanna Cummings of Salem, at her death in 1644, among
many other items possessed a feather bed, flock bolster and a green
rug, jointly valued at &#163;2. 5. 0.</p>

<p>In the "hall" of John Goffe's house, in Newbury, in 1641, were
found "3 bedsteeds, &#163;1; 1 pr. curtains with 3 rods, 18s.; 1 green
rugg, &#163;1. 6.; 2 blankets, 15 s.; 1 bed, bolster and 4 pillows, &#163;4. 10.;
1 coverlet, 10s.; and 1 bed matt, 2s."</p>

<p>The next year William Howard, afterwards the first town clerk of
Topsfield, was one of the appraisers of the estate of Samuel Smith
of Enon, the name by which Wenham was then known. In one of
the chambers he found a "bed, blancits &amp; coverlet" which he valued
at &#163;7. 8. Rather a valuable bed, or, may it have been the coverlet? In
connection with "cobbard clothes" at &#163;1. he lists a "carpitt" at 15s;
and this carpet, curiously enough, he did not find on the floor but
on a table. Joanna Cummings owned a "carpet &amp; table" that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
valued at 7s. 8d. Joseph Metcalf of Ipswich had "a table &amp; old
carpett" worth &#163;1. In the parlor of Governor Endecott's house in
Boston were found a "Table, Carpet &amp; 3 stools," valued at 50s.
William Bacon's "carpets &amp; qushens" were worth &#163;1. 10s. and in
the inventory of the estate of Rev. Ezekiel Rogers of Rowley, appears
the following: "a presse and a litle Table with ther Carpets,
&#163;1. 10s."</p>

<p>John Whittingham lived in Ipswich and died in 1648. In the
parlor of his house was found a "Joyne Table with Five chairs &amp;
one ould Carpet, 10s.; one cupboard and Cloth, 10s.; 2 paire
Cobirons, 15s.; two window Curtains and curtaine rods, 6s.; one
case of Bottles, 5s.; Books, &#163;6. 5s.; Eleven Cushions, &#163;1. 10s.; one
Still, 5s.;" and perhaps most important of all&mdash;"one fetherbed, one
flockbed, two boulsters, one pillow, one p. blankets, one Rugge,
Curtains &amp; valients and bedsted, &#163;12." In the chamber over the
parlor was another bedstead well supplied with furnishings, including
two quilts, a blue coverlet and a trundle bed. This upstairs
chamber had wall hangings which were valued at &#163;2. 10s. and in
the room were six trunks, a chest and a box, containing stores of bed
linen, table cloths, napkins, hose yarn, silver plate and eleven
spoons. Two chairs, four stools, a screen, two pairs of cobirons and
a pair of tongs completed the furnishings of the room. It almost
stands open before us. And those wall hangings valued at &#163;2. 10s.!</p>

<p>Another parlor chamber in a house in Newbury, in which had
lived the minister, the Rev. James Noyes, was more meagerly furnished.
Here the appraisers found "2 boxes, 4 hogsheads, a musket
and a gun and two swords, &#163;2.; a bolster and a quilt &amp; two blankets
and a parsell of Cotton wooll, &#163;3. 10s."</p>

<p>Just one more inventory&mdash;the estate of William Clarke who
died in 1647 in Salem. The parlor contained a half-headed bedstead
with curtains and vallance which was furnished with a feather
bed and bolster, a straw bed and flock bolster, white blankets,
sheets, and a green rug. In a corner of this parlor stood another
bedstead having a mat, canvas flock bed, sheets, old blankets and a
red rug, and in the chamber over the kitchen was a low bedstead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with a flock bed and bolster, a blanket, a rug and an old quilt.</p>

<p>Here are two kinds of bedsteads mentioned in this house, but
there were other kinds in frequent use at the time: high beds and
side beds, canopy bedsteads, half-headed, joined, cabin, corded,
close, press, standing, truckle and trundle bedsteads and what is
strange indeed, not a single example of these early bedsteads has
been preserved. All have been worn out or destroyed&mdash;supplanted
by a newer fashion&mdash;and we today can only imagine their various
forms and decorations.</p>

<p>In the New England vernacular, materials for quilts were
"skurse" in the olden times. The settlers, of course, brought all
their furnishings from England and a few years elapsed before
wool and flax were produced here in any quantity. Meanwhile all
fabrics were imported and paid for by shipments of salt fish, furs,
lumber, corn, etc. A brisk trade soon sprang up with the West
Indies and Spain and cotton was brought into the New England
ports. Some of the fabrics in common use before 1650 have names
that sound strangely in our ears. Darnacle has been mentioned.
There were baize for jackets, calico for dresses, linsey woolsey for
heavy skirts, serge for various articles of clothing, coifing stuff for
caps, linen for forehead bands and many other uses, dimity for bed
hangings and petticoats, and a fabric known as "barber's stuff." In
time some of these materials became available for quilt making and
at a still later time the handwoven, home-dyed fabrics were used
and some of these were rudely decorated with tied and dipped patterns
or stamped and stencilled designs.</p>

<p>It should always be kept in mind, however, that geographical
location largely enters into the production and character of the
quilt, and the family that was "well-off" of course would be supplied
more abundantly with furnishings and be less dependent
upon homely makeshifts and the daily practice of household
economy. Those living in the seaport towns, where most of the
shops were found, would be likely to follow the simplest course of
fashion and buy from the stock just imported from England or
Holland. The hand loom was found everywhere but more generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in the country. Weaving was a trade for men and so practiced,
but many a farmhouse had its loom and every country home
its spinning wheel. In the larger towns the dame of social position
or comfortable means would devote her spare moments to needlework
and embroidery, while in the country the housewives would
make pieced quilts or patch the clothing of their numerous children.</p>

<p>It naturally follows, that the handwoven coverlet, should be a
product of the country rather than the town and usually of the
countryside farthest removed from the influences of the shop and
of English goods. Even today it is still woven in the remote settlements
of Eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, and judging from
existing examples the vogue of the handwoven coverlet was greater
in New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and the Middle West
than in New England although many fine examples were produced
here. The manufacture of the patchwork quilt as a domestic art also
seems to have reached its highest development in the Middle West
during the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The patchwork quilt of New England is known as the "pieced
quilt" when made in the Middle West and more correctly so, for
<em>to piece</em> means to join together separate pieces of like material into
sections or blocks that in turn are united to form the top of the
quilt. The pieces usually are of uniform shape and size and contrasting
colors are blended to form the design&mdash;usually a geometric
pattern. These pieces are sewed "over and over" on the wrong side.
To <em>patch</em> means to mend or adorn by adding a patch or by laying
over a separate piece of cloth. The French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">applique</i> well describes
the patched or laid-on work where the design is cut out and
applied or sewed on, in fact, "sewed-on quilts" and "laid quilts"
are old terms. This type of quilt is found in New England but infrequently
as compared with the "pieced quilt," here commonly
known as the "patchwork quilt."</p>

<p>In early times the pieces were nearly always of a woolen fabric,
the brighter colored cloth being saved for the more central portions
of the design. Every scrap and remnant of material left from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
making of garments was saved and the best pieces of worn-out garments
were carefully cut out and made into quilt pieces. The historian
of the Saco Valley, Maine, relates that a scarlet broadcloth
cloak formerly worn by a Lord Mayor of London and brought to
Massachusetts by a member of the Merritt family of Salisbury,
Mass., after many adventures ended its days as small bits of vivid
color in a patchwork quilt made in Maine. Portions of discarded
military uniforms, of flannel shirts and well-worn petticoats were
utilized and frequently an old blanket would be used for lining.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Concerning Their Apparel</span></h3>


<p>In 1630 there were differences in dress even more so than at
the present time. The simple, coarse clothing of the yeoman
and the worker in the various trades was far removed from
the dress of the merchant and the magistrate. Leather clothing
was very generally worn by laborers and servants as deerskins
were cheap and leather had been in common use for jerkins and
breeches in Old England, so naturally it was worn here. Stockings
were made of a variety of materials and most shoes had
wooden heels.</p>

<p>Higher in the social scale men wore doublets and full breeches
and clothed themselves as well as their estates permitted&mdash;sometimes
even better than they could well afford. Sleeves were slashed.
Falling bands at the neck were common and a deep linen collar
appears in portraits of the period. A beaver or felt hat with steeple
crown was worn, and gloves, sometimes elegantly embroidered,
were essential. The accepted idea of Puritan dress should be revised
and the Victorian standard of sentimental simplicity be discarded.
There was great variety of fabrics available in the shops of London
and Bristol as will be noted in the list at the end of this chapter, and
as wealth permitted probably much of this material eventually
found its way to the shelves of the shopkeepers in Boston and other
of the larger seaport towns.</p>

<p>The following list of clothing each man should provide himself
with on sailing for New England in 1629, when the Rev. Francis
Higginson came over, is so specific that we can easily visualize the
male company that arrived at Salem that year.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fine clothing surrounded itself with fine furnishings, according
to the standards of the period, and as the wealth of the Colony increased
with the successful exportation of fish, lumber, beaver, and
peltry, it supplied them with all kinds of luxuries and refinements.
The ships were crossing frequently and the Colony kept pace with
the mother country much as the country follows the city at the
present time.</p>

<p>In the town of Ipswich, lived Madam Rebecka Symonds, writing
in her sixtieth year to her son in London to send her a fashionable
"lawn whiske," for her neckwear. In due time he replied that
the "fashionable Lawn whiske is not now worn, either by Gentil or
simple, young or old. Instead where of I have bought a shape and
ruffles, which is now the ware of the gravest as well as the young
ones. Such as goe not with naked necks ware a black wifle over it.
Therefore, I have not only Bought a plaine one y't you sent for,
but also a Luster one, such as are most in fashion."</p>

<p>The dutiful son also purchased for his mother's wear a feather
fan; but he writes to her "I should also have found in my heart, to
have let it alone, because none but very grave persons (and of them
very few) use it. Now 'tis grown almost as obsolete as Russets, and
more rare to be seen than a yellow Hood." When the feather fan
reached Ipswich it was found to have a silver handle and with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
came "two tortois fans, 200 needles, 5 yds. sky calico, silver gimp,
a black sarindin cloak, damson leather skin, two women's Ivorie
Knives, etc."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Human nature and human frailities were much the same in the
seventeenth century as at the present time, and before long, the
magistrates considered it desirable to curb the extravagancies of
dress that followed the London mode; and to induce a spirit of
economy more fitting to the poverty of a new settlement. The
ministers controlled the lawmaking body and sumptuary laws were
enacted which are enlightening. Because of "newe and immodest
fashions" the wearing of silver, gold and silk laces, girdles and hat
bands was prohibited. It was the fashion at that time to slash the
sleeves so that a fabric of another color worn beneath would show
in an ornamental manner through the slash. The ministers decreed
that neither man nor woman should wear clothing with more than
one slash on each sleeve and another on the back. "Cutt-works, inbroidered
or needle worke capps, bands &amp; rayles," were forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Ruffs and beaver hats were prohibited, as was long hair.
Binding or small edging laces might be used, but the making or
selling of bone lace was penalized at the rate of five shillings per
yard.</p>

<p>But this didn't change human nature and although from time to
time offenders were taken into court and punished, the wearing of
fine clothing fashioned after the London mode continued and a
few years later the ministers tried their hand again. Any kind of
lace was anathema and "no garment shalbee made with short
sleeves, whereby the nakedness of the arme may bee discovered."
On the other hand, large sleeves were forbidden, so the maids and
goodwives of the time must have been somewhat at a loss to know
how lawfully to fashion their clothes.</p>

<p>The minister at Ipswich grew so ill-tempered over the ungodly
state of the women in his town that he vented his spleen as follows:
"When I hear a nugiperous Gentledame inquire what dress
the Queen is in this week, what the nudius tertian of the Court, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
look at her as the very gizzard of a trifle, the product of a quarter
of a cypher, the epitome of nothing, fitter to be kickt, if she were of
a kickable substance than either honoured or humoured."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The minister in the adjoining town, Rowley, actually cut off his
nephew from his inheritance because he wore his hair long in the
prevailing fashion. Later in the century the offense of wearing
long hair was forgotten in the unspeakable sin of wearing wigs.
The Great and General Court again took a hand and in 1675 condemned
"the practise of men's wearing their own or other's hair
made into periwigs." Judge Sewall in his <cite>Diary</cite> alludes to the
custom. In 1685 three persons were admitted to the Old South
Church in Boston. "Two wore periwigs," comments the Judge.</p>

<p>"1708, Aug. 20, Mr. Chievar died. The Wellfare of the Province
was much upon his Spirit. He abominated Periwigs."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The Great and General Court at one time ordered that no person
should smoke tobacco in public under a penalty of two shillings
and six pence, nor in his own house with a relative or friend. But
everybody smoked who wanted to, even the maids, and the repressive
legislation in time met the usual fate of similar efforts to restrain
individual liberty and manners.</p>

<p>It is sweet to fancy Priscilla at her spinning wheel wearing the
coif and nun-like garb of the Puritan maiden of the poet and the
artist. But the inventories of estate in the early years of the Colony,
as well as at a later time, furnish evidence of a different character.
The variety of fabrics listed is amazing and holds its own with the
modern department store. There are most of the well-known
fabrics of today, such as calico, cambric, challis, flannel, lawn, linen,
plush, serge, silk, velvet, and many others; and there are also
names that sound strangely in modern ears, viz.: cheney, darnex,
dowlas, genting, inckle, lockrum, ossembrike, pennistone, perpetuana,
sempiternum, stammell, and water paragon.</p>

<p>As for dress&mdash;the women wore bonnets, caps, silk hoods, coifs,
forehead cloths, ruffs, and whisks. Gowns, cloaks, mantles, and
muffs are mentioned frequently; as are many kinds of lace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
even fans and veils. Shawls and scarfs were not unknown and there
were gold, silver, and enamelled rings. Women possessed masks,
and stomachers were not uncommon. Tortoise shell combs appear;
all well-to-do persons wore gloves, and as for shoes&mdash;there were
shoes with French heels, fall shoes, and those with silver buckles.
Even shoe strings appear in the inventories. There were silver,
pewter, and steel buttons and those of gympe, thread, and silk.</p>

<p>Laboring men wore leather and coarse fabrics and for others
there were suits, doublets, waistcoats and breeches. Trousers are
mentioned; also a cane and periwigs. Of caps and hats there were a
number of kinds&mdash;felt, castor, demi-castor, and even straw. Capt.
George Corwin, a Salem merchant, owned a cloth coat trimmed
with silver lace, a velvet coat, a tabby doublet, an old-fashioned
Dutch satin doublet, four cloaks of various kinds, two pairs of
golden topped gloves, one embroidered pair, and a pair with black
fringe. He also took his walks abroad wearing silk stockings, with
a hat encircled by a silver band and carrying a silver-headed cane or
a plate hilt rapier, according to fashion. He possessed two silver
watches. Who shall say that the men and women of the New
England colonies did not dress well and live well in the early days
according to their means?<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In the late 1600's, and until comparatively recent times, working
men very generally wore frocks, a custom in dress that dates
back into the centuries. It was an almost universal custom for farmers
and those employed in the mechanic trades to wear a frock. The
farmer generally looked upon the frock as an outer garment&mdash;something
to put on in colder weather or to slip on to protect underclothing
or to conceal an untidy appearance. It was a garment to
take off on coming into the house or to put on when going to the
village or to market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Carters or truckmen also habitually wore frocks. Drake, in his
"Landmarks of Boston," describes the old-time trucks, not to
exceed eighteen feet in length, with their loads of hogsheads of
molasses and other heavy merchandise balanced on the one axle
and the two horses harnessed tandem, the head horse led by the
truckman. With the disappearance of these ponderous vehicles also
went "that distinctive body of men, the 'Boston Truckmen,' who
once formed a leading and attractive feature of our public processions,
with their white frocks and black hats, mounted with their
magnificent truck-horses. Hardy and athletic, it would be hard to
find their equals on either side of the water. The long jiggers now
used are scarcely less objectionable than the old trucks." Drake
wrote this only seventy-five years ago but the "jiggers" of his time
have now almost entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>The frock was a loose garment slipped on over the head and in
length usually reached halfway between the knees and the feet.
The opening in front reached from the neckband nearly to the
waist and was closed by buttons, though sometimes a gathering
string was used. The bottom was cut up eight or ten inches, on the
sides, to permit greater freedom in walking. There were long
frocks and short frocks, the latter being generally worn indoors.
The frocks worn in workshops by mechanics were short.</p>

<p>One early source of information exists in the advertisements of
runaway servants to be found in the eighteenth-century Boston
newspapers. During the quarter-century following 1725, the <cite>Boston
News-Letter</cite> printed thirty-seven advertisements asking for
the detention of white male servants, twenty-one of whom ran
away during the cold-weather months. Of the latter, six wore
frocks or carried frocks in their bundle of clothing. It is fair to assume
that some of these men may have taken with them only their
best clothing and left working garments behind, hence the small
number of frocks specifically mentioned. This possibly may have
been the fact in the instance of an Irish servant, aged twenty-six,
who ran away in December, 1741, from his master, James Hunt of
York, Maine. He wore a broadcloth coat and jacket of a cinnamon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
color, a pair of orange colored plush breeches and a good beaver
hat. The reward for his detention was &#163;3.</p>

<p>John Davis, a servant of Mr. Okenden of Boston, absented himself
from service in March, 1728, and among other clothing he
took with him a brown fustian frock, and a pair of striped ticking
breeches.</p>

<p>Frocks and "trouzers" were part of the personal effects of William
Davison, a tailor, in King Street, Boston, that were advertised
for sale at public vendue in November, 1729.</p>

<p>Charles Daly, an Irish boy, who ran away from his master in
Boston, in December, 1732, wore a fustian frock and another Irish
servant who ran away from a brigantine at Boston four years later,
wore a new frock and trowsers.</p>

<p>An Irish servant of Captain Luce of Boston, a cooper by trade,
took with him when he disappeared in December, 1737, a frock
and a pair of "trowsers." Ten years later a negro servant who ran
away from the North End of Boston, took with him a new ozen-brig
frock.</p>

<p>The settlers came provided with English-made shoes it is likely
of a quality similar to those provided by John Hewsen in 1629, the
contract reading: "To make eight pair of welt-neat's leather shoes,
crossed on the outside with a seam, to be substantial, good over
leather of the best, and two soles, the inner sole of good neat's
leather, and the outer of tallowed backs."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In 1651, the stock of
Robert Turner of Boston, shoemaker, was inventoried as follows:
23 pairs of children's shoes at 9d. per pair; 29 pairs of No. 11, at
4/4; of No. 12, at 4/8; of No. 13, at 4/10 per pair; 20 dozen
wooden heels at 8d. per dozen; 14 pairs boots at 14/ per pair.</p>

<p>In 1672, a committee of the town of Boston, considering that
people in low circumstances "will wear no other shoes or boots generally
but of the newest fashion and highest price" proposed that a
law should be enacted that no shoemaker shall sell to any inhabitant,
shoes of 11 or 12 sizes above five shillings a pair and so in proportion
as to other sizes.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>During the first half century following the arrival of the settlers,
red colored stockings were much worn in New England and
russet and green colored stockings were also in fashion. Stockings
made of wash leather were worn. In 1675 cloth stockings sold at
14/ to 18/ a dozen pairs. In 1675 John Usher of Boston wrote to
his principal in London: "Your stirrups and turn-down stockings
are not salable here."</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Bay Company sent over in its stock, in 1629,
a hundred black hats made of wool and lined in the brim with
leather and at the same time came one hundred Monmouth caps,
so-called from the place where they were manufactured, and
valued at two shillings each. With them came five hundred red
knit caps, milled, at five pence each. Beaver hats were also worn at
that time and in 1634 prohibited by order of the General Court.
In 1651, a shopkeeper in Boston, sold black hats at 14s. 16s. and
5s.; colored hats brought 10s. and others, 8s.; children's were 3/6;
black castors, 14s. and coarse felt hats, 3s. each.</p>

<p>In 1675 a Bostonian wrote to a friend in London, that the local
market for sugar-loaf or high-crowned hats was dull.</p>

<p>The Monmouth or military cocked hat, for men, began to come
into fashion about 1670, with an average width of brim of six
inches. Their inconvenient width led to the practice of having one
flap fastened to the side of the crown, either before or behind, and
then to having two flaps alike secured. During the reign of Queen
Anne, the brim was caught up in three flaps, and so the triangularly
cocked hat became the fashion.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Doublets were made of leather, usually red in color, and fastened
with hooks and eyes. They were large on the shoulders, having
much cutwork showing the linen shirt beneath. Toward the
end of the century their popularity waned and they were succeeded
by the waistcoat. The jerkin was made of leather and also various
kinds of cloth and sometimes is mentioned in inventories. It was
worn by laboring men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pewter in the Early Days</span></h3>


<p>In the spring of 1629, when the Secretary of the Company
of the Massachusetts Bay in New England was preparing a
memorandum of materials to be obtained "to send for Newe
England" in the ships that sailed on April 25th of that year, among
the fabrics and food stuffs, the seed grain, potatoes, tame turkeys,
and copper kettles of French making without bars of iron about
them, were listed brass ladles and spoons and "pewter botles of
pyntes &amp; qrts." The little fleet reached Naumkeck (now Salem) on
June 30th, and on its return voyage, a month later, Master Thomas
Graves, the "Engynere," expert in mines, fortifications, and surveys,
who had come over with Governor Endecott the previous
year, sent home a report to the Company in which he listed "such
needefull things as every Planter doth or ought to provide to go
to New-England," including victuals for a whole year, apparel,
arms, tools, spices, and various household implements, among
which appear "wooden platters, dishes, spoons and trenchers," with
no mention of pewter. The records of the Company make mention
of carpenters, shoemakers, plasterers, vine planters, and men skillful
in making pitch, salt, etc., but nowhere does the trade of the
pewterer appear.</p>

<p>Pewter did not come into general use among the more prosperous
farmers in England until about the middle of the sixteenth
century and then only as a salt&mdash;a dish of honor, or three or four
pieces for use on more formal occasions. It was the wooden trencher
that was commonest in use in all middle-class families until well
after the year 1700, and this was true both in New England and
Old England. In homes where the shilling was made to go as far
as possible, the wooden trencher, like the homespun coat, lingered
in use for a century later. At least one family in Essex County,
Massachusetts, was still using its wooden plates of an earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
period as late as 1876, when the menfolk left home to work for
two or three days in the early fall on the thatch banks beside Plum
Island river. And this happened in a comfortably situated, but
thrifty, family. The rough usage given the common tableware in
the crude camp by the marshes had taught the housewife the desirability
of bringing down from the chest in the attic, at least once
a year, the discarded wooden plates used in her childhood.</p>

<p>Pewter appears early in the Massachusetts Colony in connection
with the settlement of estates of deceased persons. By means of the
detailed inventories taken at such times, it is possible to reconstruct
with unquestioned accuracy the manner in which the homes of the
early settlers were furnished, and by means of this evidence it is
possible to show that the hardships and crudities of the first years
were soon replaced by the usual comforts of the English home of
similar station at the same time. The ships were crossing the Atlantic
frequently and bringing from London, Plymouth or Bristol,
to the new settlements, all manner of goods required for sale in
the shops that had been set up in Boston, Salem and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In 1635 the widow Sarah Dillingham died at Ipswich, leaving a
considerable estate. Among the bequests were a silver bowl and a
silver porringer, and the inventory shows 40&#189; pounds of pewter
valued at &#163;2.14.0.</p>

<p>In 1640, Bethia Cartwright of Salem bequeathed to her sister,
Mary Norton, three pewter platters and a double saltcellar and to
a nephew she gave six spoons and a porringer.</p>

<p>In 1643, Joseph, the eldest son of Robert Massey of Ipswich,
was bequeathed by his father, four pewter platters and one silver
spoon. Benjamin, another son, was to receive four pewter platters
and two silver spoons, and Mary, a daughter, received the same
number as did Joseph.</p>

<p>In 1645, Lionell Chute died in Ipswich. His silver spoon he
bequeathed to his son James. It was the only piece of silver in the
house. Of pewter, he had possessed fourteen dishes, "small and
great," eleven pewter salts, saucers and porringers, two pewter
candlesticks and a pewter bottle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The widow, Mary Hersome of Wenham, possessed in 1646
one pewter platter and two spoons. The same year Michael Carthrick
of Ipswich possessed ten pewter dishes, two quart pots, one
pint pot, one beaker, a little pewter cup, one chamber pot and a salt.
In 1647, William Clarke, a prosperous Salem merchant, died possessed
of an interesting list of furniture; six silver spoons and two
small pieces of plate; and the following pewter which was kept in
the kitchen&mdash;twenty platters, two great plates and ten little ones,
one great pewter pot, one flagon, one pottle, one quart, three pints,
four ale quarts, one pint, six beer cups, four wine cups, four candlesticks,
five chamber pots, two lamps, one tunnel, six saucers and
miscellaneous old pewter, the whole valued at &#163;7. The household
also was supplied with "China dishes" valued at twelve shillings.
John Lowell of Newbury, in 1647, possessed three pewter butter
dishes. John Fairfield of Wenham, the same year, had two pewter
fruit dishes and two saucers; also four porringers, a double salt,
one candlestick and six spoons, all of pewter. His fellow-townsman,
Christopher Yongs, a weaver, who died the same year, possessed
one bason, a drinking pot, three platters, three old saucers,
a salt and an old porringer, all of pewter and valued at only ten
shillings. There were also alchemy spoons, trenchers and dishes
and a pipkin valued at one shilling and sixpence.</p>

<p>When Giles Badger of Newbury died in 1647 he left to his
young widow a glass bowl, beaker and jug, valued at three shillings;
three silver spoons valued at &#163;1, and a good assortment of
pewter, including "a salt seller, a tunnell, a great dowruff" and
valued at one shilling. The household was also furnished with six
wooden dishes and two wooden platters. The inventory of the
estate of Matthew Whipple of Ipswich totalled &#163;287.2.1, and included
eighty-five pieces of pewter, weighing 147 pounds and
valued at &#163;16.9.16. In addition, there were four pewter candlesticks
valued at ten shillings; two pewter salts, five shillings; two
pewter potts, one cup and a bottle, four shillings and sixpence; one
pewter flagon, seven shillings; twenty-one "brass alchimic spoones"
at four shillings and four pence each; and nine pewter spoons at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
eighteen pence per dozen. The inventory also discloses one silver
bowl and two silver spoons valued at &#163;3.3.0; six dozen wooden
trenchers, valued at three shillings; also trays, a platter, two
bowles, four dishes, and "one earthen salt."</p>

<p>The widow Rebecca Bacon died in Salem in 1655, leaving an
estate of &#163;195.8.6 and a well-furnished house. She had brass pots,
skillets, candlesticks, skimmers, a little brass pan, and an excellent
supply of pewter, including "3 large pewter platters, 3 a size lesse,
3 more a size lesse, 3 more a size lesse, &#163;1.16; 1 pewter bason, 5s;
6 large pewter plates &amp; 6 lesser, 9s; 19 Pewter saucers &amp; 2 fruite
dishes, 11s, 6d; 1 old Pewter bason &amp; great plate, 3s; 2 pewter
candlesticks, 4s; 1 large pewter salt &amp; a smal one; 2 pewter porringers,
3s.6d; 1 great pewter flagon; 1 lesser, 1 quart, 2 pints &amp; a
halfe pint, 13s; 2 old chamber pots &amp; an old porringer, 3s." She
also died possessed of "1 duble salt silver, 6 silver spones, 1 wine
cup &amp; a dram cup of silver, both &#163;6."</p>

<p>The Rev. James Noyes of Newbury, when he died in 1656, was
possessed of an unusually well-equipped kitchen, supplied with
much brass and ironware and the following pewter, viz.: "on one
shelfe, one charger, 5 pewter platters and a bason and a salt seller,
&#163;1.10.0; on another shelfe, 9 pewter platters, small &amp; great, 13
shillings; one old flagon and 4 pewter drinking pots, 10 shillings."
No pewter plates or wooden trenchers are listed.</p>

<p>In other estates appear some unusual items, such as: a pewter
brim basin, pewter cullenders, pewter beer cups, pewter pans,
pewter bed pans, and a mustard pot.</p>

<p>The trade of the pewterer does not seem to have been followed
by many men in New England during the seventeenth century.
The vessels were bringing shipments from London and moreover,
the bronze moulds used in making the ware were costly. Pewter
melted easily and frequently required repairing, and it was here
that the itinerant tinker or second-rate pewterer found employment.
The handles of pewter spoons broke easily, and a spoon
mould was a part of the equipment of every tinker. The earliest
mention we have noted of the pewterer practising his trade in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
England is one Richard Graves of Salem. He was presented at a
Quarterly Court on February 28, 1642-43 for "opression in his
trade of pewtering" and acquitted of the charge. Then he was
accused of neglecting to tend the ferry carefully, so it would seem
that pewtering occupied only part of his time. This he acknowledged,
but said that he had not been put to it by the Court and also
that it was necessary to leave the ferry when he went to mill, a quite
apparent fact. He seems to have been a somewhat reckless fellow in
his dealings with neighbors, for he was accused of taking fence rails
from Christopher Young's lot and admonished by the Court. At
the same session he was fined for stealing wood from Thomas
Edwards and for evil speeches to him, calling him "a base fellow,
&amp; yt one might Runn a half pike in his bellie &amp; never touch
his hart."</p>

<p>Graves came to Massachusetts in the "Abigail," arriving in July,
1635. He settled at Salem and was a proprietor there in 1637.
Sometimes he is styled "husbandman." He got into trouble with
the authorities very soon, and in December, 1638, was sentenced
to sit in the stocks for beating Peter Busgutt in his own house. Peter
made sport of the Court at the time of the trial, and in consequence
was ordered to be whipped, this time by the constable. In 1641
Graves was brought into court again and William Allen testified
that "he herd Rich Graves kissed Goody Gent twice." Richard confessed
that it was true, and for this unseemly conduct he was
sentenced to be fined or whipped. The records do not disclose his
individual preference as to the penalty eventually inflicted. In
1645 he was in Boston in connection with some brazen moulds that
were in dispute. A Mr. Hill and Mr. Knott were concerned in the
affair, and very likely the moulds were for pewterers' use. On another
occasion a few years later, when Graves went to Boston, he
got drunk at Charlestown, and in consequence was mulct by the
Quarterly court. Only a month later he was complained of for
playing at shuffleboard, a wicked game of chance, at the tavern kept
by Mr. Gedney in Salem, but this time he escaped the vengeance of
the law, for the case against him was not proved. He was still pursuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
his trade of pewterer in 1655 when he so styled himself in a
deed to John Putnam, and sometime between that date and 1669
he passed out of reach of the courts to that bourne from which no
pewterers ever return.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the fact that London-made pewter was
brought into New England at frequent intervals to supply the
natural demand. An invoice of pewter shipped from London in
1693 has recently come to light in the Massachusetts Archives, and
is here printed as being of interest not only as showing the market
prices for pewter, but also the kind of utensils in demand at that
time. This particular shipment of pewter was a part of a consignment
made by John Caxy of London to Joseph Mallenson, his
agent in Boston. It consisted of a great variety of clothing, fabrics,
hardware, implements, kitchen utensils and pewter. The part of
the invoice that comprised the shipment of pewter follows, viz.:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Farmhouse and the Farmer</span></h3>


<p>The farmers in the early days had few conveniences and
comforts and were largely dependent for the supply of
their wants upon the products of their farms. But little
food was purchased. At the outset domestic animals were too valuable
to be killed for food but deer and other wild game were plentiful.
When this no longer became necessary and an animal was
killed by a farmer, it was the custom to lend pieces of the meat to
the neighbors, to be repaid in kind when animals were killed by
them. In this way the fresh meat supply was kept up for a long
time by the killing of one animal. Other parts of the meat were
salted and kept for a number of months before all was eaten.
Nearly every family had a beef and a pork barrel (called a "powdering
tub"), from which most of the meat used in summer was
taken. Meat was not found upon the table every day.</p>

<p>The chimney in the farmhouse was of great size, occupying relatively
a large amount of the space inside the house. The kitchen
fireplace usually was large enough to accommodate logs four feet
in length, oftentimes even larger. In making a fire a backlog, a
foot or more in diameter, was placed against the back of the fireplace;
a forestick was then placed across the andirons in front, and
wood piled between, producing a hot fire, and giving the kitchen a
very cheerful appearance. Large stones were sometimes used instead
of a backlog, and an iron bar was laid on the andirons in front
of the forestick. Ample ventilation was had by the constant current
of air that passed up the chimney.</p>

<p>In sitting before an open fire it was often complained that while
one was roasted in front he was frozen in the back and this led to
the use in nearly every family of a long seat made of boards called
a "settle," with a high back to keep off the wind from behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
which, when placed before the fire, was usually occupied by the
older members of the family.</p>

<p>At night, any fire that remained was carefully covered with
ashes and was expected to keep until morning to kindle for the next
day. This was called "raking up the fire," and calculation was made
to have enough fire to cover up every night, so it need not be lost.
If the fire didn't keep over, some one would go with a fire pan to a
neighbor, if one lived near, and borrow some fire. But if this was
inconvenient, resort was then had to the tinder box. Tinder was
made by charring cotton or linen rags. The box containing this was
usually kept in a niche made in the side of the fireplace, by leaving
out a couple of bricks. By striking fire with flint and steel, the
tinder was ignited. Homemade matches, which had been dipped
in melted brimstone, were set on fire by touching the burning tinder
and in this way a fire was obtained. Sometimes fire was kindled by
flashing powder in the pan of a flint-lock musket, thereby setting
paper on fire. Friction matches did not come into use until about
1832.</p>

<p>The cooking was done over and before the open fire. Boiling
was done by suspending kettles from pot hooks which were upon
the crane and of different lengths to accommodate the height of
the fire. An adjustable hook which was called a "trammel" was not
infrequently used. Meat was roasted by passing through it an iron
rod called a spit and this was rested on brackets on the back of the
andirons in front of the fire and by repeated turning and exposing
on all sides, the meat was evenly cooked. Another method was to
suspend the meat or poultry by a line before the fire. By twisting
the line hard it would slowly unwind. Of course some one had to
be in frequent attendance to twist the cords and usually it was a
child. A dish placed underneath caught the drippings from the
roast. Sometimes the line would burn off, and have to be replaced
before the cooking could be completed.</p>

<p>Potatoes and eggs were roasted in the ashes by wrapping them
in wet leaves or paper, and then covering with hot coals. In half an
hour or so the potatoes would be well cooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>At first bread and other things were baked in a Dutch oven. It
was a shallow cast-iron kettle with long legs and a cover of the
same material, having a raised edge. The cover was filled with live
coals, and then the oven was suspended from a pot hook or stood
in the hot coals. It was used for both baking and frying. Indian
bannock, made from corn meal mixed with water and spread about
an inch thick on a board or wooden trencher, was baked before the
fire by setting it on an incline against a sad-iron or skillet, the top
a couple of inches back from the bottom, and when baked and made
into milk toast it was considered a dish fit to be "set before a king"!</p>

<p>The brick oven was in the chimney of nearly every well-built
house. The opening was inside the fireplace and was closed by a
wooden door. In heating the oven dry pine wood, which had been
spilt and seasoned out of doors for a short time and then housed,
was a necessity for the best results. The oven was considered hot
enough for a baking when the black was burned off the roof and
the whole inside had assumed a uniform light color. The coals
and ashes inside the oven were then removed with a "peel," a long-handled
iron shovel made for the purpose. The bottom of the oven
was then swept clean with a broom made of hemlock or other
boughs. The process of removing the fire and getting it ready for
use was called "clearing the oven."</p>

<p>The food to be cooked was then put in the oven: brown bread
made from rye and Indian meal, drop cakes made with milk and
eggs and wheat flour, which were placed directly upon the bricks
and when baked and eaten hot with butter, were considered a great
luxury. Beans, meats, potatoes, pies, and many other things were
cooked in the brick oven at the same time.</p>

<p>Families in good circumstances, made it a rule to heat the oven
daily, but Saturday was generally reserved for the week's baking.</p>

<p>The skins of animals killed on the farm were tanned by some
local tanner and a year or more was required by the old process,
but it produced an excellent quality of leather.</p>

<p>The utmost economy was practiced. Nearly all the young people
and some of the older ones went barefoot during the summer. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
going to meeting on Sunday the girls and young women often
walked a number of miles. They wore heavy shoes or went barefooted,
carrying their light shoes in their hands to save wear until
near the meeting house.</p>

<p>In the early years following the settlement, all clothing or materials
were brought from overseas but in time, flax and wool were
produced on many farms, and the women of the family were capable
of taking the wool as it came from the sheep, cleansing, carding
and spinning it into yarn, and then weaving it into cloth, from
which they cut and made the clothes for the family. The carding
was done with hand cards similar to those used for carding cattle,
only a little larger and of finer mesh. The carded rolls were spun
into yarn upon the hand wheel. Five skeins was considered a good
day's work.</p>

<p>The yarn was woven into cloth on the hand loom, which was a
ponderous affair and occupied a great deal of room. Not every
family possessed a loom, but there were weavers in every locality.
The yarn which went lengthwise of the cloth had to be drawn into
the harness by hand; that which went the other way came from
the shuttle. The yarn which was in the shuttle was wound upon
short quills, which were pieces of elder three inches in length with
the pitch punched out, and these quills were wound on a wheel
called a "quill wheel" which made a great deal of noise. This
work was usually done by children or some helper, while the
woman of the house was weaving.</p>

<p>Weaving was hard work and five or six yards was considered
a good day's work. Cotton was sometimes bought and worked in
about the same manner as wool. When the yarn was to be knitted,
it was generally colored before using. The dye pot was of earthenware
and had its place in the chimney corner just inside the fireplace.
It was covered with a piece of board or plank on which the
children often sat. The dye was made of indigo dissolved in urine.
Into this the yarn was put and remained until it was colored. When
the yarn was wrung out, or the contents disturbed, the odor that
arose had no resemblance to the balmy breezes from "Araby the
blest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The cloth for men's wear was called "fulled cloth." After it
was woven it was taken to the clothier, where it was fulled, dyed,
sheared, and pressed. That worn by women was simply dyed and
pressed, and was called pressed cloth. Baize without any filling or
napping was woven for women's use.</p>

<p>Flax was grown on the farm. It was pulled in the fall and placed
upon the ground, where it remained a number of months until the
woody portion was rotted and the fiber became pliable. When at
the right stage it was broken by a clumsy implement called a "flax
brake," which rid the fiber of the woody parts. It was then
"swingled," which was done by beating it with a wooden paddle
called a "swingling knife," which prepared it for the comb or
"hatchel" made of nail rods. Its teeth were pointed and about six
inches longer, seven rows with twelve in each row. The combing
took out the short and broken pieces which was called tow and spun
into wrapping twine, small ropes and bagging. When the flax had
been combed sufficiently it was put upon the distaff and spun.</p>

<p>The linen wheel was about twenty inches in diameter and was
operated by the foot resting upon a treadle. The wheel had two
grooves in the circumference, one to receive a band to drive "the
fliers," the other to drive the spool with a quicker motion to take up
the threads. The thread when spun and woven into cloth, was
made up into shirts, sheets, table covers, dresses, handkerchiefs,
strainer cloths, etc. Ropes used about the farm were often home-made
of linen and tow. In the summer men wore tow and linen
clothes. A cloth made of cotton and linen was called fustian.</p>

<p>Cider mills were found on a great many farms where the apples,
which were mostly natural fruit, were made into cider. This
was a common drink and found a place upon the table three times
a day with each meal, and was carried into the fields to quench
thirst forenoon and afternoon. The men of those days assumed to
be unable to labor without a liberal supply of cider, as water
seldom agreed with them. The drawing and putting the cider
upon the table usually fell to the younger members of the family
and was generally considered an irksome task. In some cases it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
made the rule that the one who got up the latest in the morning
should draw the cider for the day. Cider which had been drawn for
a little time and had become warm was not considered fit to drink.
Any that remained in the mug was emptied into a barrel kept for
the purpose in the cellar and was soon converted into vinegar. In
this way the family supply was made and kept up, and it generally
was of the best quality.</p>

<p>When David Cummings of Topsfield died in 1761, he provided
by will that his wife Sarah should be supplied annually with five
barrels of cider, in fact, it was common among farmers to so provide
for their widows, together with a horse to ride to meeting, and
a certain number of bushels of vegetables, corn, rye, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The tallow candle was used for light in the evening. When this
was supplemented by a blazing fire in the fireplace it gave the
room a cheerful appearance. Most of the candles were "dips," although
a few were run in moulds made for the purpose. All the
tallow that came from the animals killed on the farm was carefully
saved and tried out and rendered by heating. The liquid thus obtained
was put in pans to cool and when enough had been accumulated
it was placed in a large kettle and melted. The candle wicking
was made of cotton, and was bought at the shops in town. It came
in balls. The wicking was cut twice the length of the candle and
doubled over a stick made for the purpose and then twisted together.
These sticks were two feet in length and half an inch in
diameter. Six wicks were placed upon each stick, and as many used
as would hold all the candles to be made at one time. Two sticks
six or eight feet in length, often old rake handles, were used for
supports. These were placed upon two chairs and about eighteen
inches apart. On these the sticks were placed with the wicks hanging
down. By taking a couple of the sticks in the hands the wicks
were placed in the hot tallow until they were soaked. When all
had been thus treated dipping began. Each time a little tallow adhered,
which was allowed to cool, care being taken not to allow the
dips to remain in the hot tallow long enough to melt off what had
already cooled. While the dipping was going on the candles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
suspended where a draft of air would pass over and cause them to
cool quickly. Care was also taken not to have the candles touch each
other.</p>

<p>The dipping continued until the candles were large enough for
use. If the tallow in the kettle became too cool to work well, some
boiling water was put in which went to the bottom and kept the
tallow above warm enough to work. The tallow candle made a
dim, disagreeable light, as it smoked considerably and required
constant snuffing or cutting off of the burnt portions of the wick.
Snuffers were used for this purpose, in which the portions of the
wick cut off were retained, and this was emptied from time to time
as the receptacle became filled.</p>

<p>Nearly every family made the soft soap used in washing clothes
and floors. Ashes were carefully saved and stored in a dry place.
In the spring the mash tub, holding sixty or seventy gallons, was
set up, and on the bottom a row of bricks were set on edge. On them
a framework was placed which was covered with hemlock boughs
or straw, over which a porous cloth was placed. The tub was then
filled with ashes. If any doubt existed as to the strength of the lye,
thus produced, a little lime was put in. Boiling water was then
poured on in small quantities, at frequent intervals and this was
allowed to settle. When no more water would be taken it was left
to stand an hour or more, when the first lye was drawn off. If an
egg dropped into the lye floated, all was well and good luck with
the soap was certain.</p>

<p>Ashes from any wood except pine and beech were considered
good and used with confidence. Grease that had accumulated during
the year and been saved for this purpose was then placed in a
kettle with some of the lye, and when boiled, if it did not separate
when cooled, soft soap was the result. Most farmers' wives dreaded
soap making. It was one of the hardest day's work of the year.
Usually it was made a point to have the soap making precede the
spring cleaning.</p>

<p>Men generally rode horseback to meeting and elsewhere, and
when a woman went along she rode behind on a pillion, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a small cushion attached to the rear of the saddle with a narrow
board suspended from the cushion&mdash;a support for the women's
feet. To assist in mounting and dismounting horse blocks were used
at the meetinghouse and in other public places. Small articles were
carried in saddle-bags, balanced one on each side of the horse.
Grain was carried to mill laid across the horse's back, half in each
end of the sack.</p>

<p>In the early days baked pumpkin and milk was a favorite dish.
A hard-shelled pumpkin had a hole cut in the stem end large
enough to admit the hand. The seeds and inside tissue were carefully
removed, the piece cut out was replaced, and the pumpkin
was then put in a hot oven. When cooked it was filled with new
milk and the contents eaten with a spoon. When emptied the shells
were often used as receptacles for balls of yarn, remnants of cloth
and other small articles.</p>

<p>Bean porridge was another dish that was popular. In cold
weather it was often made in large quantities and considered to
grow better with age. Hence the old saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Bean porridge hot;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bean porridge cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bean porridge in the pot,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nine days old."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>While iron shovels were brought in from England and in a
limited way were made by local blacksmiths, most shovels used by
farmers were made of oak, the edges shod with iron. Hay and
manure forks were made of iron by the blacksmith. They were
heavy, had large tines that bent easily, and were almost always
loose in the handle. It took a great deal of strength to use them.
Hoes were made by the blacksmiths, who also made axes, scythes,
knives, etc.</p>

<p>When help was wanted on the farm, the son of some neighbor
who was not as well off, or who had not enough work to profitably
employ all his sons, could be hired. He became one of the family,
took an active interest in his employer's business, and in not a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
instances married his daughter, and later with his wife succeeded
to the ownership of the farm. If help was wanted in the house,
some girl in the neighborhood was willing to accept the place. She
was strong and ready, capable and honest, and in the absence of her
mistress was able to take the lead. She was not looked upon as a
servant, and often established herself permanently by becoming
the life partner of the son.</p>

<p>Clocks were seldom found in the farmhouse. Noon marks and
sundials answered the needs of the family and when the day was
cloudy, one must "guess." Because so many had no means of telling
the time, it was customary to make appointments for "early
candlelight."</p>

<p>It was usual with most families to gather roots and herbs to be
used for medicinal purposes. Catnip, pennyroyal, sage, thoroughwort,
spearmint, tansy, elderblows, wormwood, and other plants
were saved to be used in case of sickness. Gold thread or yellow
root was saved and was a remedy for canker in the mouth. Many
of the old women who had reared families of children were skilful
in the use of these remedies, and were sent for in case of sickness,
and would prescribe teas made from some of these herbs, which
were cut when in bloom and tied in small bundles and suspended
from the rafters on the garret to dry, causing a pleasant aromatic
smell in the upper part of the house.</p>

<p>The well was usually at some distance from the farmhouse and
often located in an exposed and wind-swept position requiring
much daily travel over a snowy and slippery path in winter and
through mud and wet at other times. Convenience in the location
of the well was in too many cases overlooked. From the well all the
water used for domestic purposes was brought into the house in
buckets. The water in the well was usually drawn by means of a
well-sweep.</p>

<p>In some towns the selectmen were chosen by "pricking." A
number of names were written upon a sheet of paper. This was
passed around and each man pricked a hole against the names of
his choice. The one having the most pin holes was chosen first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
selectman, the next highest the second, and the next the third.</p>

<p>When a couple concluded to marry they made known their intention
to the town clerk, who posted a notice of their intended
marriage in the meetinghouse. This was called "being published."
By law this notice must be published three Sabbaths before the
ceremony was performed, so that any one who knew of any reason
why such marriage should not take place might appear and make
objection. In addition to the posting, the town clerk would rise in
the meeting and read the intention to marry.</p>

<p>Each landowner not only maintained his own fences around cultivated
fields, but also gave of his labor in building long ranges of
fencing about the common pasture lands in proportion to his interest
in the land. A law was enacted as early as 1633 requiring the
fencing of corn fields.</p>

<p>The earliest fences were usually made of five rails and must be
up by early in April when the cattle and hogs were turned out to
roam at large. The New England farmer, clearing his land for
cultivation, soon devised another form of fence where stones were
plentiful and by piling up these stones into walls divided off his
fields and gave them substantial protection. The well-built stone
wall must have a foundation of small stones laid in a trench to
prevent its being thrown by the frost and when carefully built it
would last for generations. Meanwhile the adjoining field had
been cleared of stones and made useful for cultivation. Hedge
fences were also in frequent use as in parts of England whence the
settlers had emigrated.</p>

<p>The roads outside the villages were seldom fenced. In fact, the
early roads were little more than ill-defined paths winding their
way across pastures and cultivated fields and whenever a dividing
farm was reached, there would be a gate or bars to be opened and
closed by the traveler.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Manners and Customs</span></h3>


<p>When the first considerable emigration ceased about the
year 1640, of the 25,000 settlers then living in the
Colony, probably ninety-five per cent were small farmers
or workmen engaged in the manual trades, together with many
indentured servants who had come over under the terms of a contract
whereby they were bonded to serve their masters for a term
of years&mdash;usually five or seven. The remaining five per cent of the
population was composed of those governing the colony&mdash;the stockholders
in the Company, so to speak; ministers enough to supply
the spiritual needs of each town and settlement, however small; a
few of social position and comparative wealth; one lawyer; and a
sprinkling of shopkeepers and small merchants living in the seaport
towns. Here and there a physician or chirurgeon might be
found, but the physical welfare of the smaller towns was usually
cared for by some ancient housewife with a knowledge of herbs and
simples. Sometimes it was the minister who practiced two professions
and cared for the bodies as well as the souls of his congregation.</p>

<p>The founders of the colony in the Massachusetts Bay, and
most of those who immediately followed them, were men who did
not conform to the ritual and government of the Established
Church in England. They were followers of John Calvin whose
Geneva Bible was widely read in England and whose teachings had
profoundly influenced English thought and manners. Calvin taught
a great simplicity of life and a personal application of the teachings
found in the Bible. In the Commonwealth that he set up in Geneva,
the daily life and actions of its citizens were as closely guarded as
if in a nursery for children. All frivolous amusements were forbidden;
a curfew was established; and all were constrained to save
souls and to labor for material development. There was a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
supervision of dress and personal conduct, and a literal construction
of Bible mandates was carried so far that children were actually
put to death for striking their parents.</p>

<p>Calvin's theology was based on the belief that all men were born
sinners and since Adam's fall, by the will of God, predestined from
birth to hell and everlasting torment, unless, happily, one of the
elect and so foreordained to be saved. In this belief the Puritans
found life endurable because they considered themselves of the
elect; and in cases of doubt, the individual found comfortable
assurance in the belief that although certain of his neighbors were
going to hell <em>he</em> was one of the elect. It naturally followed that the
imagination of the Puritans was concentrated on questions of
religion.</p>

<p>The teachings of Calvin spread rapidly in England and among
his followers there came about an austerity of religious life and a
great simplicity in dress and manners.</p>

<p>It is true that most of the settlers of Massachusetts were poor in
purse and with many of them mere existence was a struggle for a
long time. But the growth of wealth in the Colony, although it
brought with it more luxury in living and better dwellings, did not
add much to the refinement of the people. It was the influence and
example of the royal governors and a more frequent commercial
intercourse with England and the Continental peoples that brought
about a desire for a richer dress and an introduction of some of the
refinements of life. This by no means met the approval of the
Puritan ministers who frequently inveighed against "Professors of
Religion who fashion themselves according to the World." The
Rev. Cotton Mather, the leading minister in Boston and the industrious
author of over four hundred published sermons and
similar works, again and again exhorted against stage plays and infamous
games of cards and dice. "It is a matter of Lamentation
that even such things as these should be heard of in New England,"
he exclaimed. "And others spend their time in reading vain
Romances," he continued. "It is meer loss of time."</p>

<p>With such a background and burdened with such a far-reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
antagonism toward the finer things of life, that help to lighten the
burden of existence and beautify the way, it is small wonder that
the esthetics found little fertile soil in New England; and much
of this prejudice and state of mind lingered among the old families
in the more remote and orthodox communities, until recent
times.</p>

<p>The New England Puritans only allowed themselves one full
holiday in the course of the year and that was Thanksgiving Day, a
time for feasting. To be sure, there was Fast Day, in the spring,
which gave freedom from work; but that was a day for a sermon
at the meetinghouse, for long faces and a supposed bit of self
denial&mdash;somewhere. The celebration of Christmas was not observed
by the true New England Puritan until the middle of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>A number of sermons preached by Rev. Samuel Moodey, an
eccentric minister at York, Maine, for nearly half a century, were
printed and among them: "The Doleful State of the Damned,
especially such as go to hell from under the Gospel." This sermon
was followed by its antidote, entitled: "The Gospel Way of Escaping
the Doleful State of the Damned." Another of his sermons was
upon "Judas the Traitor, Hung up in Chains." Parson Moodey's
son, Joseph, followed him in the pulpit at York. He was known as
"Handkerchief Moodey," as he fell into a melancholy; thought
he had sinned greatly; and after a time wore a handkerchief over
his face whenever he appeared in public. In the pulpit he would
turn his back to the congregation and read the sermon, but whenever
he faced his people it would be with handkerchief-covered
features. Think what must have been the influence of two such men
on the life and opinions of a town covering a period of two generations!</p>

<p>During the late seventeenth century and well into the eighteenth,
the books usually found in the average New England family
were the Bible, the Psalm Book, an almanac, the New England
Primer, a sermon or two and perhaps a copy of Michael Wigglesworth's
terrific poem&mdash;"The Day of Doom." The latter was first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
printed in 1662 in an edition of 1800 copies not one of which has
survived. Every copy was read and re-read until nothing remained
but fragments of leaves. Seven editions of this poem were printed
between 1662 and 1715 and few copies of any edition now exist.
The book expressed the quintesscence of Calvinism. Here is stanza
205, expressing the terror of those doomed to hell:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They wring their hands, their caitiff-hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">and gnash their teeth for terrour:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They cry, they roar, for anguish sore<br /></span>
<span class="i3">and gnaw their tongues for horrour.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">But get away without delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Christ pities not your cry:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Depart to Hell, there may you yell,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">and roar Eternally."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pastor Higginson of Salem wrote enthusiastically of the natural
abundance of the grass that "groweth verie wildly with a great
stalke" as high as a man's face and as for Indian corn&mdash;the planting
of thirteen gallons of seed had produced an increase of fifty-two
hogsheads or three hundred and fifty bushels, London measure,
to be sold or trusted to the Indians in exchange for beaver
worth above &#163;300. Who would not share the hardships and dangers
of the frontier colony for opportunity of such rich gain?</p>

<p>But the housewives in the far-away English homes were more
interested in the growth of the vegetable gardens in the virgin soil,
and of these he wrote: "Our turnips, parsnips and carrots are here
both bigger and sweeter than is ordinary to be found in England.
Here are stores of pumpions, cucumbers, and other things of that
nature I know not. Plentie of strawberries in their time, and pennyroyall,
winter saverie, carvell and water-cresses, also leeks and
onions are ordinary." Great lobsters abounded weighing from sixteen
to twenty-five pounds and much store of bass, herring, sturgeon,
haddock, eels, and oysters. In the forests were several kinds
of deer; also partridges, turkeys, and great flocks of pigeons, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
wild geese, ducks, and other sea fowl in such abundance "that a
great part of the Planters have eaten nothing but roast-meate of
divers Fowles which they have killed."</p>

<p>These were some of the attractive natural features of the new
colony in the Massachusetts Bay, as recounted by the Salem minister.
Of the hardships he makes small mention, for his aim was to
induce emigration. There was much sickness, however, and many
deaths. Higginson himself lived only a year after reaching Salem.
The breaking up of virgin soil always brings on malaria and fever.
Dudley wrote "that there is not an house where there is not one
dead, and in some houses many. The naturall causes seem to bee in
the want of warm lodgings, and good dyet to which Englishmen
are habittuated, at home; and in the suddain increase of heate
which they endure that are landed here in somer ... those of
Plymouth who landed in winter dyed of the Scirvy, as did our
poorer sort whose howses and bedding kept them not sufficiently
warm, nor their dyet sufficient in heart." Thomas Dudley wrote
this in March, 1631. He explained that he was writing upon his
knee by the fireside in the living-room, having as yet no table nor
other room in which to write during the sharp winter. In this room
his family must resort "though they break good manners, and make
mee many times forget what I would say, and say what I would
not."</p>

<p>But these hardships and inconveniences of living which the New
England colonists met and overcame differ but little from those
experienced in every new settlement. They have been paralleled
again and again wherever Englishmen or Americans have wandered.
In a few years after the coming of the ships much of the
rawness and discomfort must have disappeared, certainly in the
early settlements, and comparative comfort must have existed in
most homes. If we could now lift the roof of the average seventeenth-century
house in New England it is certain that we should
find disclosed not only comfortable conditions of living but in many
instances a degree of luxury with fine furnishings that is appreciated
by few at the present time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the early days following the settlement Roger Clap, who
lived at Dorchester, afterwards wrote as follows:</p>

<p>"It was not accounted a strange thing in those days to drink
water, and to eat Samp or Homine without Butter or Milk. Indeed
it would have been a strang thing to see a piece of Roast Beef,
Mutton or Veal; though it was not long before there was Roast
Goat. After the first Winter, we were very Healthy: though some
of us had no great Store of Corn. The Indians did sometimes bring
Corn, and Trade with us for Clothing and Knives; and once I had
a Peck of Corn, or there abouts, for a little Puppy-Dog. Frostfish,
Muscles and Clams were a Relief to Many."</p>

<p>When Governor Winthrop landed at Salem in June, 1630, he
supped on a good venison pasty and good beer, while most of those
who came with him went ashore on Cape Anne side (now Beverly)
and gathered strawberries. That was a fine beginning, but when
winter set in many of them were "forced to cut their bread thin for
a long season" and then it was that they fully realized that "the
Ditch betweene England and their now place of abode was so
wide.... Those that were sent over servants, having itching desires
for novelties, found a reddier way to make an end of their Master's
provision, then they could finde means to get more; They that
came over their own men had but little left to feed on, and most
began to repent when their strong Beere and full cups ran as small
as water in a large Land.... They made shift [however] to rub out
the Winter's cold by the Fireside, having fuell enough growing at
their very doores, turning down many a drop from the Bottell, and
burning Tobacco with all the ease they could."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Lacking bread they lived on fish, mussels and clams. The rivers
supplied bass, shad, alewives, frost fish and smelts in their season,
also salmon, and corn meal could be bartered for with the Indians
and shortly raised from seed.</p>

<p>"Let no man make a jest at Pumpkins, for with this fruit the
Lord was pleased to feed his people to their good content, till
Corne and Cattell were increased," wrote Johnson. Later (by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
1650) the goodwives served "apples, pears and quince tarts instead
of their former Pumpkin Pies," and by that time wheat bread was
no dainty.</p>

<p>Society in the Massachusetts Bay in the seventeenth century was
divided into several groups. First came the merchant class which
also included the ministers and those possessed of wealth. Edward
Randolph reported to the Lords of Trade in 1676, that in Massachusetts
there were about thirty merchants worth from &#163;10,000. to
&#163;20,000. "Most have considerable estates and a very great trade."
Next came the freemen and the skilled mechanics. This class furnished
the town officials and constituted the backbone of the colony.
Then came the unskilled laborer and a step lower was the indentured
servant. The merchant lived well and wore fine clothing
forbidden to his more humble neighbors. The status of the servant
may well be shown by the deposition presented in Court at Salem
in 1657 by an apprentice to a stone-mason in the town of Newbury,
Massachusetts, who testified that it was a long while before "he
could eate his master's food, viz. meate and milk, or drink beer,
saying that he did not know that it was good, because he was not
used to eat such victualls, but to eate bread and water porridge and
to drink water."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>It has been stated frequently that in the olden times in New
England every one was obliged to go to church. The size of the
meetinghouses, the isolated locations of many of the houses, the
necessary care of the numerous young children, and the interesting
side-lights on the manners of the time which may be found in the
court papers, all go to show that the statement must not be taken
literally. Absence from meeting, breaking the Sabbath, carrying a
burden on the Lord's Day, condemning the church, condemning
the ministry, scandalous falling out on the Lord's Day, slandering
the church, and other misdemeanors of a similar character were
frequent.</p>

<p>Drunkenness was very common in the old days. "We observed
it a common fault in our young people that they gave themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to drink hot waters immoderately," wrote Edward Johnson. Every
family kept on hand a supply of liquor and wine, and cider was
considered a necessity of daily living in the country, where it was
served with each meal and also carried into the fields by the workers.
It was stored in barrels in the cellar and the task of drawing
the cider and putting on the table usually fell to the younger members
of the family. A man would often provide in his will for the
comfort of his loving wife by setting aside for occupancy during
her life, one half of his house, with a carefully specified number of
bushels of rye, potatoes, turnips and other vegetables; the use of
a horse with which to ride to meeting or elsewhere; and lastly, the
direction that annually she be provided with a certain number of
barrels of cider&mdash;sometimes as many as eight.</p>

<p>Rev. Edward Holyoke, the President of Harvard College, was
in the habit of laying in each year thirty or more barrels of cider as
he had to provide for much entertaining. Late in the winter he
would draw off part of his stock and into each barrel he would pour
a bottle of spirit and a month later some of this blend would be
bottled for use on special occasions.</p>

<p>What was their conduct not only in their homes but in their relations
with their neighbors? Did they live peaceably and work together
in building up the settlements? Did they set up in the wilderness
domestic relations exactly like those they had abandoned
overseas? It was a raw frontier country to which they came and it
is apparent that at the outset they felt themselves to be transplanted
Englishmen. So far as possible they lived the lives to which they
had been accustomed and they engrafted in their new homes the
manners and customs of the generations behind them. Most of
them fully recognized, however, that they were not to return; that
they had cut loose from the old home ties and it was not long before
the necessities and limitations of frontier life brought about
changed conditions in every direction. Politically, religiously and
socially, they were in a different relation than formerly in the English
parish life. Many of them, especially those somewhat removed
from the immediate supervision of magistrate and minister, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
long seem to have shown a tendency to follow the natural bent of
the frontiersman toward independent thought and action. Their
political leaders made laws restricting daily life and action and
their religious leaders laid down rules for belief and conduct, that
soon were repellent to many. Civil and clerical records are filled
with instances showing an evasion of and even contempt for the
laws and rules laid down by the leaders of their own choosing.
Some of it doubtless was in the blood of the men who had come in
search of a certain individual freedom of action, but much of it may
be attributed to frontier conditions and primitive living. There
were many indentured servants, and rough fishermen and sailors
have always been unruly. Simple houses of but few rooms accommodating
large families are not conducive to gentle speech or
modesty of manner nor to a strict morality. The craving for landholding
and the poorly defined and easily removed bounds naturally
led to ill feeling, assault, defamation, and slander.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sports and Games</span></h3>


<p>This is a subject on which there is little recorded information
to be found. Undoubtedly the background of English
life, restrained by Calvinistic severity, was continued by
the children and youth among the settlers. This must have been
among the commonplaces of daily life and of so little importance
to the future that no one considered it worthy of recording. It is
impossible to think of child life without its natural outlet of sports
and games&mdash;throw ball, football, running, swimming, etc., and
we know that dolls and toys for children were for sale in the shops
of Boston and Salem as early as 1651.</p>

<p>The Indians indulged in similar sports and played "hubbub," a
game resembling dice, with much shouting of "hub, hub, hub,"
accompanied by slapping of breasts and thighs.</p>

<p>The innocent games of childhood may be taken for granted and
their English origins may be studied in Strutt's <cite>Sports and Pastimes
of the People of England</cite>. It was gambling, and tavern amusements
that the magistrates endeavored to control.</p>

<p>In 1646 complaints having been made to the General Court of
disorders occasioned "by the use of Games of Shuffle-board and
Bowling, in and about Houses of Common entertainment, whereby
much precious time is spent unprofitably, and much waste of
Wine and Beer occasioned"; the Court prohibited shuffle-board
and bowling, "or any other Play or Game, in or about any such
House" under penalty of twenty shillings for the Keeper of the
house and five shillings for every person who "played at the said
Game." As we now read this ancient law the waste of precious
time and the undue amount of wine and beer consumed would seem
to be the principal occasion for the anxiety of the Court, for the
game of bowls is excellent exercise and innocent enough; shuffle-board,
however, may well be looked upon with sour eyes. It required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a highly polished board, or table, sometimes a floor thirty
feet in length, marked with transverse lines, on which a coin or
weight was driven by a blow with the hand. It bore some resemblance
to tenpins, the object being to score points attained by
sliding the coin to rest on or over a line at the farther end of the
board. The game induced wagers and thereby a waste of substance
and even in Old England was unlawful at various times, but difficult
to suppress.</p>

<p>Massachusetts magistrates also enacted a law at the 1640 session,
prohibiting any play or game for money or anything of value
and forbade dancing in taverns upon any occasion, under penalty
of five shillings for each offence. The observance of Christmas or
any like day, "either by forbearing labor, feasting, or any other
way" was also prohibited under penalty of five shillings for each
person so offending. This action was occasioned by "disorders arising
in several places within this jurisdiction by reason of some still
observing such Festivals, as were superstitiously kept in other
Countries, to the great dishonour of God and offence of others."</p>

<p>Strange as it may now seem, the non-observance of Christmas
existed in orthodox communities, especially in the country towns,
until well up to the time of the Civil War.</p>

<p>The magistrates having learned that it was a "custome too frequent
in many places, to expend time in unlawful Games, as Cards,
Dice, &amp;c." at the same court decreed a fine of five shillings imposed
on all so offending. Twenty-four years later the penalty was
mightily increased to five pounds, one half to go to the Treasurer
of the Colony and the other half to the informer. This was because
of the increase of "the great sin of Gaming within this Jurisdiction,
to the great dishonour of God, the corrupting of youth, and expending
of much precious time and estate."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>All this legislation seems to have been directed against indulgence
in gaiety and human weakness in and about a public tavern.
What took place within the home was another matter although the
orthodox Puritan continued to frown upon card playing and dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
until very recently. But cards and gambling were common at
all times among the merchants and governing class as well as
among the laborers and this was especially true in the seaport towns
where sailors congregated and where there was more or less contact
with the Southern colonies and with foreign lands. In 1720
playing cards cost a shilling a pack at James Lyndell's shop in
Boston and a few years later David Gardiner was advertising
Bibles, Prayer Books, account books, playing cards, and a great
variety of other goods. Card tables appeared in inventories of
estates, and were offered for sale by the cabinet makers.</p>

<p>At an early date horses became a prime article of trade with the
West Indies, where they were used in the sugar cane crushing mills,
and wherever horses are bred, questions of speed must naturally
arise and therefore trials of speed and racing in the public eye.</p>

<p>This was a corrupting influence in the opinion of the Magistrates&mdash;"that
variety of Horse racing, for money, or moneys worth,
thereby occasing much misspence of precious time, and the drawing
of many persons from the duty of their particular Callings, with
the hazard of their Limbs and Lives." It therefore became unlawful
"to practice in that Kind, within four miles of any Town, or in
any Highway, the offenders, if caught, to pay twenty shillings
each, the informer to receive one half."</p>

<p>But public opinion at a later date changed somewhat and here
are a few items gleaned from Boston newspapers that demonstrate
the fact that human nature two centuries ago was much the same as
at the present time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horse Race.</span> This is to give Notice that at Cambridge on Wednesday

<p>For many years it was necessary for Massachusetts men to defend
their families from marauding Indians and the French, and
military trainings were held at regular intervals. In May, 1639, a
thousand men took part at a training in Boston and in the fall of
that year there were twelve hundred. Such occasions provided opportunity
for feasting and drinking&mdash;perhaps we should say drunkenness&mdash;but
as the years went by the prayers and singing of psalms
gave way to days of public enjoyment and not infrequently to
boisterous license. Governor Bradford wrote that the water of
Plymouth was wholesome though not, of course, as wholesome as
good beer and wine. Even so!</p>

<p>New England Puritans hated Christmas, a day for Popish revelry.
On Christmas Day in 1621, those who had recently arrived at
Plymouth in the ship <em>Fortune</em> entertained themselves with pitching
the bar and playing stoolball, but at noon Governor Bradford
appeared and ordered them to stop "gameing or revelling in the
street."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> On Christmas Day, 1685, Judge Sewall wrote in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Diary, "Carts come to town and shops open as usual. Some somehow
observe the day, but are vexed I believe that the Body of the
People Prophane it, and blessed be God no authority yet to compel
them to keep it."</p>

<p>Commencement Day at Harvard was also a day for diversion
and vied in importance in the public eye with election day and
training days.</p>

<p>By the year 1700 billiard tables might be found in many of the
larger taverns and sometimes a ninepin alley. In 1721, Thomas
Amory of Boston was shipping billiard tables to his correspondents
in the Southern ports.</p>

themselves in a very unusual manner, and otherwise disfiguring
themselves as well as insulting the Inhabitants in their

Case of Refusal: which Doings being very disorderly, and contrary

<p>Jacob Bailey, a country boy born in 1731 of humble parentage
in Rowley, Mass., was inspired by the local minister to obtain a college
education, and after graduating at Harvard, he taught school,
eventually obtained a license to preach, and finally went to England
where he took orders in the Anglican Church. Bailey had a
gift for versification and while teaching school in the country town
of Kingston, N.H., his muse led him to describe a corn husking, a
favorite frolic in country towns until very recent times, an occasion
when the finding of an ear of red corn entitled the finder to
kiss the girls. He begins:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The season was cheerful, the weather was bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When a number assembled to frolic all night."<br /></span>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Aunt Nabby's, "where kisses and drams set the virgins on
flame," horseplay soon developed. Ears of corn were thrown,
especially at loving couples, the girls were tumbled about on the
husks and practical jokes found their victims. When supper was
ready</p>

<p class="center">
"Like crows round a carcass each one took his place
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The girls in a huddle stand snickering by<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till Jenny and Kate have fingered the pie."<br /></span>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And after supper the "scenes of vile lewdness" abashed the country
schoolmaster:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The chairs in wild order flew quite round the room:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Some threatened with fire brands, some branished a broom,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While others, resolved to increase the uproar,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lay tussling the girls in wide heaps on the floor."<br /></span>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Quite sick of confusion, dear Dolly and I<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Retired from the hubbub new pleasures to try."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><br />Bailey's closing comment is illuminating; "from many of these
indecent frolics which I have seen in these parts, I must conclude
that rustics are not more innocent than citizens,"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and we may rest
assured that country manners and customs south of the Merrimack
River were no different from those north of it.</p>

<p>In country towns much of the population was thinly distributed
and it was impossible for the housewife to run in next door for a
few moments' idle chat. Frequently the nearest house was a half-mile
or more distant and the feminine desire for social diversion
was sadly curbed by the constant demands of farm labor for horses
that otherwise might have been used in the chaise or wagon. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
weekly gathering at the meetinghouse was always looked forward
to with some anticipation by both old and young and the sacredness
of the day did not prevent discreet conversation on purely secular
topics. But the day when farmer Perkins raised the frame of his
barn was made a social event in the full meaning of the word and
when the "raising" of the meetinghouse took place, it certainly was
a gala day, for in town meeting it was voted to buy a barrel of rum
and twelve barrels of cider, with sugar, beef, pork, and brown and
white bread in proportion with which to refresh the gathering.
Eighty-seven pounds of cheese were eaten and the town paid one
shilling and six pence for the mugs that were broken&mdash;let us hope
purely by accident. But "raisings" occurred at infrequent intervals.
Each fall, however, there were corn huskings in various parts of
the town and afterwards always plenty to eat for the jolly workers.
The women were invited to apple bees and sometimes there
were spinning parties. Every winter brought its singing school in
the district schoolhouse and spelling matches sometimes brought
together the fathers and mothers of the district as well as their
sons and daughters. But the quilting party was always welcomed
by the women with the keenest relish. It was their personal affair.
They were free for a time from the noisy interruptions of the
children and the men were not in the way although sometimes invited
to a supper. As the quilted pattern advanced over the surface
"the women gossiped of neighborhood affairs, the minister, the
storekeeper's latest purchases, of their dairies, and webs and linens
and wools, keeping time with busy fingers to the tales they told."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Trades and Manufactures</span></h3>


<p>In the new settlements on the Massachusetts Bay, one of the
prime necessities was men skilled in the various trades, "an ingenious
Carpenter, a cunning Joyner, a handie Cooper, such a
one as can make strong ware for the use of the countrie, and a good
brickmaker, a Tyler, and a Smith, a Leather dresser, a Gardner,
and a Taylor; one that hath good skill in the trade of fishing, is of
special use, and so is a good Fowler."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The Company had sent
over men to govern and ministers to care for spiritual affairs and
many of those who came were skilled husbandmen.</p>

<p>Many of the smaller towns found themselves without men
skilled in the mechanic trades and this was particularly the case
with blacksmiths, a very essential trade in every community. This
led to grants by towns of land and buildings as inducement for
smiths to settle and work their trade. Carpenters were found everywhere,
and brickmakers naturally gravitated to deposits of clay
while the other craftsmen became distributed in accordance with
the law of supply and demand, each taking on apprentices as had
been customary in their old homes in England.</p>

<p>The principal productions available for commerce were fish,
lumber, furs and foodstuffs, but the building of shipping and the
importance of the carrying trade must not be overlooked. In the
way of domestic manufactures the sawmill came first. The earliest
were built on or near the Piscataqua River, but wherever water
power was available they soon were set up replacing the laborious
saw pits. As the woodlands were cut off the sawmills moved
farther up the stream or logs were brought to the mill-sites by
floating down with the current. The best of the tall trees were
marked with the King's broad arrow and reserved for masts for
the royal navy and mast ships sailed for England from Portsmouth,
N.H., at frequent intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The shipbuilding industry required iron and shortly an iron
works was set up at Saugus, where bog iron from the neighboring
swamps and meadows was smelted. The enterprise was financed in
London and largely worked by Scotch prisoners sent over after
the defeat at Dunbar, but the quality of the product proved unsatisfactory,
save in the way of casting pots and kettles, and before
long the enterprise got into financial difficulties and was abandoned.</p>

<p>The high cost of imported iron forced the colonists to fashion
wood to serve their needs not only for agricultural implements but
for nearly all the utensils used in the household. Massachusetts
staves and hoops were important articles of export to the sugar
islands in the West Indies.</p>

<p>The raising of flax and the manufacture of linen were attempted
early to supply domestic needs in country households. Families in
seaport towns very generally bought their fabrics in the local shops
which imported their stocks from London or Bristol.</p>

<p>In 1642 it was estimated there were a thousand sheep in Massachusetts
and it was not long before the colony was sending wool
to France and Spain in exchange for wines, fruits and other
luxuries.</p>

<p>The history of early American manufactures has been told in
Edward H. Knight's <cite>American Mechanical Dictionary</cite>, 3 volumes,
Boston, 1876, and William B. Weeden's <cite>Economic and Social History
of New England</cite> (1620-1789), 2 volumes, Boston, 1894,
makes easily available an immense amount of research. In the following
pages are printed gleanings from Boston newspapers and
court records that supplement these works and have the readable
flavor of their period.</p>

of "the great Decay of Trade and Business the Number of
Poor is greatly increased, and the Burden of supporting them lies

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Concerning Shipping and Trade</span></h3>


<p>New England, with its many rivers and indented
coastline, until recent years, has been a breeding place
for sailors and a location for shipbuilding. During the
first century following the settlement, the larger part of the population
lived near the coast, and as roads between towns were poor,
it naturally followed that craft of small tonnage were constantly
employed for transport on the ocean and the navigable rivers, and
as no extent of rich soil was found awaiting cultivation, many settlers,
of necessity, turned to fishing and to trade. A ship carpenter
was brought over to Plymouth, in 1624, who "quickly builte them
2 very good and strong shalops ... and a great and strong lighter,
and had ... timber for 2 catches" framed when he fell sick of a
fever and soon died.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> These shallops were used in opening a fur
trade among the Indians on the Kennebec River that eventually
discharged the indebtedness of the Pilgrims to the London adventurers.</p>

<p>Six shipwrights were sent over by the Company of the Massachusetts
Bay, in the spring of 1629, together with a considerable
stock of ship stores, such as pitch, tar, cordage and sail cloth.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Doubtless these men were employed at the outset in housing the
settlers and in building small fishing boats, as the first vessel of
any size in the Bay, of which there is record, is Governor Winthrop's
trading bark, <em>The Blessing of the Bay</em>, of thirty tons, built
mainly of locust, which went to sea, August 31, 1631, on a voyage
to the eastward and afterwards traded with the Dutch at New
Amsterdam.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>In January, 1633, Emanuel Downing wrote to the Council for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
New England that he had made enquiries of Mr. Winthrop respecting
the ship carpenters employed in New England and found
that the plantation was able to build ships of any burden. Their
most competent shipwright was William Stephens, who had built
in England, the <em>Royal Merchant</em>, a ship of six hundred tons.</p>

<p>The General Court, in 1639, exempted ship carpenters and
fishermen (during the fishing season) from compulsory military
training.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Two years later the Court was informed that some shipwrights
were scanting their work and an order was adopted providing
for a survey of all ship construction as was usual in England
at that time.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The coasting trade led to the building of small shallops and
sloops and the need for firewood in Boston and Charlestown
brought about the building of sloops, broad of beam, intended
especially for that trade. Fishing craft and wood sloops were soon
being built all along the coast. As early as 1634, one merchant in
Marblehead owned eight fishing craft, and Portsmouth, N. H.,
had six great shallops, five fishing boats, with sails and anchors, and
thirteen skiffs, in the trade as early as 1635. Richard Hollingsworth,
in 1637, had a shipyard at Salem Neck and in 1641, built
"a prodigious ship of 300 Tons."</p>

<p>The number of New England vessels used in foreign trading
during the seventeenth century was considerable and the mainstay
of the trade was the fishing business. Off-shore fishing in the early
days was carried on in shallops&mdash;capacious, open boats carrying several
pairs of oars and also fitted with masts and sails. They were
sometimes decked over, in whole or in part, and usually carried
one mast with a lug sail. Many of these small craft were built in
the winter time by the fishermen and their sons, as a fisherman is
always more or less of a boatbuilder by virtue of his calling. The
lumber for the boat would be cut in the common woods and got
out, a little at a time, and the boat when built would actually cost
its owner little more than the outlay for certain necessary fittings.
These boats might be framed-in anywhere&mdash;on the beach in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the fisherman's cottage; in his dooryard or in the woods, some
distance from the shore, to which the hull would be dragged by
oxen, on sledges of timber. The first vessels sent to "the banks,"
from Massachusetts, for deep-water fishing, were "a ship and other
vessels," rig unknown.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> That was in 1645.</p>

<p>By 1665 there were three hundred New England vessels trading
with Barbadoes, Virginia, Madeira, Acadia, etc., and 1,300
smaller craft were fishing at Cape Sable. Cod and mackerel were
caught and salted. The best fish were sent to Malaga and the
Canaries, the second sort to the Portugal Islands, and the worst to
the Barbadoes there to be used in the diet of the negro slaves. At
that time, the principal commodities produced in the Massachusetts
Bay were fish and pipe-staves, masts, fir-boards, pitch, tar, pork,
beef, and horses and corn which were sent to Virginia, Barbadoes,
&amp;c. Tobacco and sugar were taken in payment and shipped to England.
Excellent masts were shipped from the Piscataqua River,
and many pipe-staves. There were more than twenty sawmills
located on that river and "much good timber was spoilt," reported
an agent of Lord Arlington, the Secretary of State.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> New England
masts, 33 to 35 inches in diameter, at that time cost the Navy Commissioners
from &#163;95 to &#163;115 per mast. The agent also reported
that Boston, the chief town, was "built on a peninsula in the bottom
of a bay, which is a good harbour and full of fish. The houses are
generally wooden, the streets crooked, and neither days, months,
seasons, churches, nor inns are known by their English names."</p>

<p>During the middle years of the seventeenth century the waters
of the West Indies were covered with privateers commissioned to
prey upon Spanish commerce. Not only did the home government
issue these commissions but every Colonial governor as well, and
not infrequently it was difficult to separate privateering from
piracy. John Quelch, who was hanged in Boston for piracy, in
1704, preyed upon Portuguese commerce as he supposed in safety
and not until he returned to Marblehead did he learn of the treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of peace that made him a pirate. In 1653, Thomas Harding captured
a rich prize sailing from Barbadoes and in consequence was
tried in Boston for piracy, but saved his neck when he was able to
prove that the vessel was Dutch and not Spanish.</p>

<p>The town of Newport, R. I., frequently profited from the visits
of known pirates, as in 1688, when Peterson, in a "barkalonga" of
ten guns and seventy men, refitted at Newport and no bill could be
obtained against him from the grand jury, as they were neighbors
and friends of many of the men on board. Two Salem ketches also
traded with him and a master of one brought into "Martin's Vineyard,"
a prize that Peterson, "the pirate, had taken in the West
Indies."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Andrew Belcher, a well-known Boston merchant, and
master of the ship <em>Swan</em>, paid Peterson &#163;57, in money and provisions,
for hides and elephants' teeth, taken from his plunder.</p>

<p>The ill-defined connection between privateering and piracy
was fully recognized in those days and characterized publicly by
the clergy. In 1704 when Rev. Cotton Mather preached his "Brief
Discourse occasioned by a Tragical Spectacle in a Number of Miserables
under Sentence of Death for Piracy," he remarked that
"the Privateering Stroke so easily degenerates into the Piratical;
and the Privateering Trade is usually carried on with an Unchristian
Temper, and proves an Inlet unto so much Debauchery and
Iniquity."</p>

<p>Another strong influence that led to insecurity on the high seas
and eventually to outright piracy was the operation of the English
Navigation Acts. European nations were in agreement that the
possession of colonies meant the exclusive control of their trade
and manufactures.</p>

<p>In 1696, Col. Charles Lidgett, a New England merchant, in
"Some Considerations Offered to the Board of Trade," wrote that
"all the American Colonies are generally esteemed according to
the Conveniency and benefit they bring to England, their Mother."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Lord Chatham wrote, "The British Colonists in North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
America have no right to manufacture so much as a nail for a
horse shoe," and Lord Sheffield went further and said, "The only
use of American Colonies, is the monopoly of their consumption,
and the carriage of their produce."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>English merchants naturally wished to sell at high prices and to
buy colonial raw materials as low as possible and as they were unable
to provide a market for all that was produced, the Colonies
were at a disadvantage in both buying and selling. By the Acts of
Navigation certain "enumerated articles" could be marketed only
in England. Lumber, salt provisions, grain, rum and other non-enumerated
articles might be sold within certain limits but must be
transported in English or plantation-built vessels of which the
owners and three-fourths of the mariners were British subjects.
Freight rates also advanced, as other nations, notably the Dutch,
had previously enjoyed a good share of the carrying trade.</p>

<p>The first Navigation Act was passed in 1645. It was renewed and
its provisions enlarged in 1651, 1660, 1663 and later. Before long
it was found that these attempts to monopolize the colonial markets
resulted in a natural resistance and smuggling began and also an
extensive trade with privateers and pirates who brought into all
the smaller ports of New England captured merchandise that was
sold at prices below the usual market values. Matters went from
bad to worse and servants of the Crown frequently combined with
the colonists to evade the obnoxious laws. Even the Royal Governors
connived at what was going on. This was particularly true
in the Colonies south of New England.</p>

<p>There were pirates and pirates. Some were letters-of-marque
and illegitimate traders and enjoyed the protection of merchants
and officials on shore, while others were outlaws. In 1690, Governor
Bradstreet of the Massachusetts Colony was complaining of
the great damage done to shipping by "French Privateers and
Pirates," and four years later, Frontenac, the Governor of Canada,
was asking for a frigate to cruise about the St. Lawrence against
the New England "<em>corsaires and filibusters</em>." There is no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
these French privateers were a considerable menace to New England
shipping and that there was need for privately armed vessels
to protect the coast, a task not easy or desirable; so why should one
scrutinize too closely semi-piratical captures made by so useful
friends?</p>

<p>The profits of piracy and the irregular trade practiced at that
time were large, and twenty-nine hundred per cent profit in illicit
trade was not unusual, so there is little wonder that adventurous
men took chances and honest letters-of-marque sometimes seized
upon whatever crossed their course. The pirate, the privateer and
the armed merchantman often blended the one into the other.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Edward Randolph landed in Boston on June 10, 1676, and
during the next week the following vessels arrived: "a Bostoner,
100 tons, Clutterbuck, master, from Nantes, laden with 50 butts
of brandy and French commodities; a pink, of Boston, from
France, of 70 tons, with 12 tun of brandy, wine, etc.; a Scotsman,
130 tons, from the Canaries, with 80 pipes of Canary; a Bostoner,
80 tons, from the Canaries, with 50 pipes of Canary, and a ketch of
Southampton, from Canary, with wine."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He reported to Secretary
Coventry that the fishermen had made good voyages notwithstanding
the war with the Indians. He estimated that the fish exported
amounted to about &#163;50,000 yearly with profitable returns
in barter on masts and timber for shipping sent to Barbadoes and
other of the Carib Islands. The Bay of Campeachy supplied about
1,000 tons of logwood annually. The maritime towns were well
stored with sailors, fishermen and carpenters, and yearly several
ships of good burthen were built, besides ketches and barques. In
1676 thirty vessels had been ordered set on the stocks by merchants
in England, but the Indian War had prevented building the full
number. However, twelve were in process of construction at Boston,
Charlestown, Salisbury and other places, some of which were
upwards of 160 tons burthen.</p>

<p>In October he wrote that there were about thirty merchants in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine estimated worth from
&#163;10,000 to &#163;20,000. Local commodities consisted of naval stores,
cattle and provisions, exported to Virginia, Maryland and the West
Indies&mdash;(to the latter were also sent "houses ready framed"), to
Spain, Portugal, the Straits and England. Tobacco, sugar, indigo,
cotton, wool, ginger, logwood, fustic, cocoa and rum were imported
and again exported. "They trade with most parts of Europe
from which they import direct all kinds of merchandise, so that
little is left for English merchants to import," wrote Randolph.
"Some ships have been sent to Guinea, Madagascar, etc., and some
to Scanderoon; there are built in the Colony, 730 ships varying
from 6 to 250 tons, by thirty master shipbuilders." Duties were
imposed on provisions and wines imported, and on ships, but there
was no custom on exports, except on horses.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In April, 1675, William Harris wrote from Boston that "The
merchants seem to be rich men, and their houses [are] as handsomely
furnished as most in London. In exchange of fish, pipe-staves,
wool and tobacco, they have from Spain, Portugal, and the
islands, the commodities of those islands; their wool they carry to
France and bring thence linen; to England they bring beaver,
moose, and deer skins, sugar and logwood, and carry hence cloth
and ironwares; to Barbadoes, in exchange for horses, beef, pork,
butter, cheese, flour, peas, biscuit, they have sugar and indigo;
when they trade with Jamaica; as they do sometimes, they bring
home pieces of eight, plate, and pigs of silver.... As to cloth, there
are made here Linsey woolseys, and other of cotton and wool, and
some all sheep's wool, but the better sort of linen is brought from
England; they have many woolcombers, and some make tammeys,
but for their private use. Salt they get from Tortudas, not far
from Barbadoes. It is sold at 10s. the hogshead, and is clear and
white as alum, very sharp and much stronger than ordinary bay
salt."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Governor Simon Bradstreet wrote in 1680, in answer to an enquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
from the Lords of the Privy Council: "There may bee near
twenty English merchants within our Government bred up to that
calling, and neere as many others that do trade and merchandize
more or less; but Foreign merchants of other Nations Wee have
none ... there are two or three [merchants] in our Corporation
that may bee worth sixteen or eighteen thousand pound a piece,
some few others worth eight or ten Thousand pounds a piece, a
third sort worth four or five thousand pounds a piece.... Hee is

most of them belonging to the Colony, wee have eight or ten ships
of one hundred tons or upwards, three or four of two hundred tons
or more, and about Forty or Fifty Fishing Katches of betwixt
twenty and Forty tons; Six or eight English ships do usually come
hither yearly belonging to the Kingdom of England, bringing
commodities of all sorts from thence.</p>

<p>"The obstructions wee [encounter] within our trade are the generall

<p>By this time the Colonists were all comfortably housed according
to the standards of the period and were producing all the
foodstuffs needed and more. Wines and spirit were imported in
considerable quantity to give variety to the native beer and cider.
Much butter and cheese were brought from abroad and also luxuries
such as spices, chocolate, raisins of the sun, almonds, figs, oranges,
etc. Our English ancestors were gross eaters and drinkers. Mulled
and spiced wines were drunk in the absence of tea and coffee, and
highly-seasoned dishes were popular. The absence of a variety of
root-crops made it necessary to pickle meat and pepper and spice
were used to a considerable extent. There was a very comfortable
and varied diet among the merchant and governing class but the
farmers and common people lived much on salt pork, beans, fish
and boiled foods. As for clothing&mdash;home industry, of course, provided
a certain amount but as yet the loom was not in common use.
Between 1665 and 1675 over three hundred estates were settled in
Essex County, Massachusetts, with only nine looms listed in the
inventories. Eighty-three of these homes, however, possessed spinning
wheels&mdash;cotton, linen and wool&mdash;for every good wife and
child could knit stockings, mittens and tippets. Among those who
died during this ten years were two tailors, five shoemakers, a
cloth worker and eight weavers.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>Much clothing was brought from overseas, particularly for the
town dwellers. John Hull, the mintmaster, records in his diary
in June, 1657, that three ships arrived from London bringing supplies
of clothing, "for, as yet," he writes, "our chief supply, in
respect of clothes, is from England." He owned a number of vessels
and his little ketches were constantly on the go between Boston
and the Barbadoes and thence to Bilboa, London or Bristol. He
shipped salted fish, logwood, tobacco, furs and plantation products
and received iron in bars, salt, wines and fruits from Spain, while
from England came dress goods, lead, shot, etc. His serges he
wanted "sad coloured," none above 42 shillings, nor under 30
shillings. He also instructed one of his captains to load "dowlass
and good nowell convass [which was used for sails], Dutch duffalls,
red penystones and flanils, no such scalet cloth as you
brought me before." He looked askance at calicoes. Another time
he called for duffalls, white, striped or blue, with red and blue
stockings, none above 16 shillings and under if possible. He wanted
no "kersey" that cost above 46 pence per yard and the black
stuff, either of "hair or wosted," must be cheap.</p>

<p>A cousin once advised him to ship a cargo of pipe-staves, hoops
and fish to the Canaries, but he declined the venture and wrote in
reply that he "would more and more affect and imbrace opportunity
of getting out rather than running into the businesses of this
world Speacially forraigne trafficque as desirous to be more thoghtfull
of Lanching into that vast ocian of Eternity whither we must
all shortly bee carried yt soe I might bee in a prepared posture for
my Lord's Comeing."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>His sea captains were carefully instructed "to see to the worship
of God every day in the vessel and to the santification of the Lord's
day and suppression of all prophaness that the Lord may delight
to be with you and his blessing be upon you which is the hearty
prayer of youre frind and own<sup>r</sup>." The sailors were not all to this
way of thinking, however, but Mintmaster Hull rode with the
ruling party which saw to it that the Quarterly Courts were kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
busy measuring out the metes and bounds. In the journal of the
voyage over kept by the Reverend Higginson in 1629, he records
a visitation of avenging Providence; a just retribution inflicted
upon the ungodly. He writes, "this day a notorious wicked fellow
yt was given to swearing and boasting of his former wickednes and
mocked at y<sup>e</sup> daies of fast, railing &amp; jesting ag<sup>t</sup> puritans, this fellow
fell sicke of ye [small] pocks and dyed."</p>

<p>It is interesting to discover at how early a date it was possible to
purchase in the shops in New England, the manufactured products
of Old England. It is known that George Corwin set up a shop in
Salem, for the sale of fabrics and hardware, as early as 1651, or
only twenty-five years after the first immigration. His shop was
well stocked and at the outset he was selling such luxuries as children's
toys. Undoubtedly stocks of manufactured goods were on
sale in the Colony years before this time. In the matter of house
hardware Corwin sold a considerable variety of locks. He carried
stock locks of several sizes, spring locks with screws, single and
double chest locks, warded outside chest locks, outside box locks,
plain cupboard locks and small and large padlocks&mdash;by no means a
poor assortment for a small shop tucked into a corner in the American
wilderness.</p>

<p>This shop, a few years later, was supplying the town with such
articles as combs, white haft knives, barbers' scissors, flour boxes,
carving tools, carpenter's tools of all kinds, door latches, curry
combs and brushes for horses, and a great variety of earthen and
woodenware. Its shelves held broadcloth, red cloth rash, perpetuana,
red cotton, sad colored rugs, green rugs, green Tammy, blue
calico, crape, curley duroy, prunella, silk barronet, peniston, Persian
silk, worsted faradeen, camblet, St. Peter's canvas, hall cloth,
vittery, blue linen, noyles, together with a great variety of hose,
stomachers, ribbons, tape, fileting, silk and gimp laces, needles,
pins, thread, buttons, etc., etc.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The invoice of an importation made into Boston in 1690, contains
such items as brass curtain rings, dressing glasses, square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
monument candlesticks, iron spring candlesticks, brass extinguishers
and save-alls, tin lanterns, pocket nutmeg graters, bread graters,
wooden rat traps with springs and a great variety of woodenware.
It seems strange that New England should import from across seas
wooden plates and bowls, yet here they are:</p>

<p>
9 doz. best Maple Trenchers @ 30/ per dozen<br />
1 doz. Porridge Dishes at 11/4.<br />
</p>

<p>Here also are carved spoons, beer taps, hair sieves, sucking bottles
and milk trays.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>From the returns of outward and inward entries at the Colonial
ports, the records of which are now preserved in the Public Record
Office in London, much may be learned concerning early shipping
and trade in the Massachusetts Bay. Let us take, for example,
the last six months in the year 1714, covering the outward entries
of shipping at the port of Boston. During that time there were 236
clearances not including, of course, fishermen and coasting craft.
The rig is not stated in the first part of the register but between
Sept. 21st and December 31st there were cleared 49 ships, 18 brigantines,
64 sloops, two barques, one snow, one pink, and a "ship or
snow" of 40 tons. Not a schooner is mentioned. The largest ship
measured 210 tons and the smallest was the <em>Grayhound</em> of London,
a British-built vessel of 33 tons, carrying a crew of five men
and a cargo of dyewood, turpentine, whale oil, barrel staves and
sugar. With the exception of five ships hailing from London, every
vessel cleared was "plantation built," that is, it had been built in
one of the American colonies. Of the 236 entries, 147 of the vessels
hailed from Boston; 18 were owned in London; six in Bristol;
four came from the West Indies; and the rest hailed from New
York, Virginia, Maryland, and other colonies. Most of them were
small craft averaging from thirty to sixty tons burthen.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Hopewell</em>, of North Carolina, five tons, and a crew of
two men, was loaded with rum and salt.</p>

<p>The <em>Swallow</em>, of Boston, 20 tons, and three men, sailed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Annapolis Royal with a cargo of tobacco, pitch, molasses, rum,
pork, and English goods for the garrison.</p>

<p>The sloop <em>Success</em>, owned in New York, 20 tons, with four
men, sailed for home carrying four hhds. rum, pewter ware, a cart,
chairs, boxes, etc.</p>

<p>The sloop <em>Pelican</em> of Boston, 25 tons, with four men, sailed for
Virginia, loaded with 42 bbls. salt, three hhds. rum, iron pots, etc.</p>

<p>The sloop <em>Sea Flower</em> of Boston, 40 tons, with six men, entered
out, the 3d day of November, carrying bread, butter, beer, onions,
and peas for the logwood cutters in the Bay of Campeachy.</p>

<p>The brigantine <em>William and Susanna</em>, owned in Salem, 40 tons,
and eight men, sailed for Virginia, carrying rum, lime juice, salt,
earthen ware, etc.</p>

<p>The sloop <em>Branch</em> of Boston, 50 tons, with six men, sailed for
South Carolina, carrying rum, blubber, onions, etc.</p>

<p>The brigantine <em>Speedwell</em> of Boston, 60 tons, with seven men,
cleared for Surinam, carrying 10 pipes of wine and twenty horses.</p>

<p>The ship <em>Brunswick</em> of Boston, 65 tons, two guns and ten men,
sailed for Barbadoes, carrying 37 hhds. fish, 50 boxes candles, and
15 boxes of soap.</p>

<p>The ship <em>Mary Ann</em> of London, 80 tons, with four guns and ten
men, entered out, bound for Lisbon, carrying 240 quintals of salted
fish, "which is the whole cargo," states the register.</p>

<p>The ship <em>Bedmunster</em> of Bristol, 100 tons, with ten men, returned
home with 18&#189; tons of logwood, 507 bbls. tar, 307 bbls.
pitch, 7 bbls. whale oil, and 40&#189; bbls. cranberries.</p>

<p>The ship <em>Amity</em> of London, 130 tons, six guns and fourteen
men, returned with a cargo of 20 hhds. sugar, 5 bags of cotton,
168 tons, 9 cwt. 1 qr. and 14 lbs. logwood, 10 bbls. pitch, pimento,
wines, furs and staves.</p>

<p>The largest ship to clear was the <em>Sophia</em> of Boston, 310 tons,
built in New Hampshire, armed with 18 guns and carrying a crew
of twenty men. She sailed for Barbadoes carrying fish, corn, candles
and lumber.</p>

<p>Among the more unusual articles of merchandise enumerated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the cargo lists are "2 cases of returned pictures," shipped to London;
pots and frying pans, to Maryland; apples, cider, Indian
meal, and six sheep, shipped to Newfoundland; 230 barrels of
cider shipped to Philadelphia; and rum, cider, iron and brass,
saddles and bridles, etc. to North Carolina. Bricks, shingles, iron
and woodenware, hops, pickled sturgeon, beeswax, rice, furs,
washed leather, linens and calicoes are mentioned.</p>

<p>The West India trade called for lumber, horses, rum, food, and
luxuries; and supplied sugar and molasses. Salt fish and pickled
sturgeon were sent to Spain, Portugal and the Western Islands&mdash;Roman
Catholic countries. The important dyewood trade in the
Bay of Campeachy required foodstuffs; and the coasting trade with
the Southern colonies called for manufactured goods of all sorts
and supplied in return tobacco, pitch, turpentine and tar, which
were used in the New England shipyards and also reshipped to
England. The fisheries in Newfoundland called for foodstuffs and
London and Bristol supplied markets for dyewoods, naval stores,
furs, whale oil, sugar, manufactured lumber, and wines brought
from Portugal and the Western Islands.</p>

<p>During the months of April, May and June, in the year 1717,
there were twenty-seven inward entries at the Salem customhouse.
All but three were plantation built. Seventeen were owned in
Salem; two hailed from London; two from Liverpool, and one
from Bristol. There were eight ships, four brigantines, twelve
sloops and three schooners. The first of these schooners to enter
was the schooner <em>Fisher</em>, 30 tons, Timothy Orne, master, registered
at the Salem customhouse, Oct. 27, 1715. This is the earliest
authentic record of a schooner I have ever found. Those vessels
having the largest tonnage were the ship <em>Patience and Judith</em>, 100
tons, owned in London, England, and carrying six guns and a crew
of fourteen men, entering from the Isle of May, with a cargo of
140 tons of salt; and, second, the ship <em>Friendship</em>, Capt. Samuel
Crow, 100 tons, owned in Salem, carrying two guns and a crew of
ten men, also entering from the Isle of May with 90 tons of salt.
Ten out of the twenty-seven entries brought in salt for the Salem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
fisheries. Rum and lignumvitae wood came from the West Indies,
and wheat, corn, beans, flour, flax, hides, pork and lard came from
Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina. The ships from English
ports brought European goods.</p>

<p>During the last three months of 1754, eighty-seven vessels
cleared outward at the Salem customhouse and sixty-eight were
schooners. The largest tonnage was the snow <em>Aurora</em> of Salem, 130
tons, built at Newbury that year, sailing for Liverpool with a cargo
of 15,000 staves and 40 tons of pine timber. Of the ten European
clearances, seven were for Bilboa, with salted fish; thirty-three
cleared for ports in the West Indies; forty for southern colonies;
and two for Newfoundland. The principal cargoes were salted fish,
manufactured lumber, rum, sugar, molasses, salt, horses, sheep,
and salted meats. Nearly all clearing for Maryland, Virginia and
the Carolinas carried cargoes of wooden, earthen and iron wares,
probably manufactured in Salem or its immediate vicinity. Twenty-six
thousand bricks were shipped to the West Indies and 20 bales
of hay to South Carolina. The two schooners clearing for Halifax
were loaded with "dead meat," probably intended for the garrison.</p>

<p>During the first three months of the year 1762, fifty-three vessels
cleared from Salem, bound for foreign ports and the southern
colonies; thirty-four were schooners. The largest vessel was the
ship <em>Antelope</em>, 150 tons, a prize, registered at Salem in 1761 and
owned by Richard Derby. She cleared for Guadaloupe with lumber,
fish, train oil, and Fyall wines. There were nineteen clearances
for Guadaloupe during those three winter months. Listed
with the staples were the following curious items, viz.: 7&#189; tons
prize soap, illegally imported, shipped to Guadaloupe; and 12,000
feet of oars, shipped to St. Christophers. There is a surprising diversity
of ownership among these fifty-three vessels. No large shipowner
had a considerable interest. Richard Derby of Salem owned
three vessels; Robert Hooper of Marblehead, two; Jeremiah Lee
of Marblehead, two; Nathaniel Ellery of Gloucester, owned two
and the rest were owned by men who cleared only one vessel.</p>

<p>The ships, that plied between English and American ports, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
more or less regular intervals during the eighteenth century, not
only brought an exchange of merchandise, but also carried passengers.
Officials connected with the government&mdash;the customs
service and the military establishment, with a sprinkling of clergymen
and scholars, were crossing on nearly every ship and the New
England merchant sailing to London to buy a new stock of goods
for his shop and the Englishman who came to the colonies bringing
adventures of goods in great variety, all helped to maintain the
service. In the year 1737, the Boston newspapers mention by name
eighteen persons who had arrived by ship or were about departing.
On January 31st, John Banister, late in business with his uncle
Samuel Banister, at Marblehead, advertised in the <cite>Gazette</cite> that he
designed speedily to embark for Great Britain and requested a settlement
of all accounts. John Jeykill, the collector of the Port of
Boston, arrived from London, April 18th, in Captain Shepardson;
early in May, Thomas Phillips of Boston, merchant, advertised
that he would sell his household furniture by vendue, as he intended
speedily for London, and a week later Major Martin and
family arrived from Antequa, in the West Indies. He proposed to
reside in Boston for a few years. Toward the last of the month, the
Lieutenant-Governor of New Hampshire sailed from Portsmouth,
bound for England, and about the middle of June, the Rev. Doctor
McSparrow and lady arrived in Boston. As late in the year as
December 20th, Edmund Quincy, Esq., the agent of the Province
at the Court of Great Britain, was sailing for London, in Captain
Homans, with several other unnamed gentlemen.</p>

<p>Very little is known at the present time concerning the intimate
details of life on board ship in the early times and especially as to
the accommodations provided for passengers. On the vessels that
brought over emigrants in any number, the living conditions must
have been well-nigh intolerable because of crowding many people
into limited space and also by reason of a meagre equipment and
lack of necessary conveniences. During the period of the German
emigration and that from northern Ireland in the mid-eighteenth
century, there was frequently a high mortality during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the voyage and sometimes, when it was of unusual length, the
supply of food and water ran short and there was terrible suffering.
Doubtless some attempt was made to separate the sexes and
the families but from time to time cases are found in the court
records in which depositions or testimony clearly show that living
conditions on board ship in the early days were decidedly of a
miscellaneous character.</p>

<p>It isn't necessary to delve into the very remote past in order to
discover casual social relations between the sexes on board ship. In
1888, I went the length of Cape Breton and while sailing up the
Bras d'Or lakes on the steamer that plied regularly during the
summer, I came on deck early one morning to see the sun rise and
then began an exploration of the boat. On the lower deck I suddenly
came upon some twenty or more barefooted and half-clothed
men and women lying in a long row, side by side, stretched out on
mattresses placed on the deck. They were probably waitresses,
cooks, stewards, and the like, but may have been second-class passengers.
However that may be, they were unconscious of the presence
of any passer-by and slept quietly together like so many
puppies.</p>

<p>In the olden time it is known that in the more regular passenger
service the main cabin was parted off at night by means of curtains.
Small cabins or staterooms were also built and especially on the
larger ships. It is impossible to imagine that it could be otherwise,
when the official station or wealth of the passenger is considered.</p>

<p>The captain's cabin had its steward and there the food and service
were undoubtedly better than that provided forward where all
slept in canvas hammocks slung from hooks in the deck timbers
overhead, or lay upon pallet beds on the deck. Here they served
themselves from the ship's galley. The foul odors below deck and
the unsanitary conditions are part of the lore of the sea. "Ship
feaver" was well known to all physicians practicing in seaport
towns. In those days the cooking was done in an open fireplace. So,
too, on shipboard there was provided an open "hearth" made of
cast iron and weighing from four to eight hundred pounds. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
was fastened to the deck and its "chimney" was screened by a
"smoke sail." A smaller "hearth" was in the captain's cabin and
supplied all the heat below. It must have been bitterly cold on
board ship during a winter crossing. The coals in these "hearths"
were a menace to safety and required constant attention.</p>

<p>A communication printed in the <cite>Boston News-Letter</cite> describes
an escape from fire on board one of these English packets. The
writer, a good New England puritan, first declares his suspicion
that a certain military gentleman, a fellow passenger from Boston,
had brought on board a fair lady who was not his wife. The couple
occupied a small cabin, partitioned off from the main cabin, which
had a curtained window looking into it. There were other curtains
about. As the Boston shopkeeper sat near the "hearth," musing
over his suspicions, a sudden lurch of the vessel brought a carelessly
placed curtain swinging into the coals on the "hearth" and in
an instant it was aflame. The shopkeeper shouted "Fire! Fire!"
which brought the major's inamorata to her cabin window and an
instant later she rushed into the main cabin with a certain necessary
receptacle in her hands. One splash and the worst was over.
The charred curtain was soon torn from its fastenings and the fire
stamped out on the cabin floor.</p>

<p>In 1760, Jacob Bailey, a native of Rowley, Mass., and a graduate
of Harvard College, having prepared for the ministry and
been licensed to preach, determined to obtain orders in the Church
of England and so, through the intervention of friends, took passage
from Boston for London in the ship <em>Hind</em>, carrying twenty
guns, which sailed in company with six other vessels. Mr. Bailey
kept a diary of the voyage and his description of the accommodations
which the ship supplied, the life on board, and the men with
whom he was brought in contact, is a surprisingly vivid picture of
strange and uncouth conditions attending passenger service to England
in the mid-eighteenth century. The ship lay at anchor in the
harbor and Mr. Bailey went out to her in a small boat.</p>

<p>"The wind was blowing strong, and it was some time before we
could get on board ship. At length, with difficulty, I clambered up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the side and found myself in the midst of a most horrid confusion.
The deck was crowded full of men, and the boatswain's shrill
whistle, with the swearing and hallooing of the petty officers, almost
stunned my ears. I could find no retreat from this dismal
hubbub, but was obliged to continue jostling among the crowd
above an hour before I could find anybody at leisure to direct me.
At last, Mr. Letterman, the Captain's steward, an honest Prussian,
perceiving my disorder, introduced me through the steerage to the
lieutenant. I found him sitting in the great cabin. He appeared to
be a young man, scarce twenty years of age, and had in his countenance
some indications of mildness. Upon my entrance he assumed
a most important look and with a big voice demanded to know my
request. I informed him that I was a passenger on board the <em>Hind</em>,
by permission of Capt. Bond, and desired that he would be civil
enough to direct me to the place of my destination. He replied in
this laconic style: 'Sir, I will take care to speak to one of my mates.'
This was all the notice, at present. But happily, on my return from
the cabin, I found my chest and bedding carefully stowed away in
the steerage. In the meantime the ship was unmoored and we fell
gently down to Nantasket....</p>

<p>"I observed a young gentleman walking at a distance, with a
pensive air in his countenance. Coming near him, in a courteous
manner he invited me down between decks to a place he called his
berth. I thanked him for his kindness and readily followed him
down a ladder into a dark and dismal region, where the fumes of
pitch, bilge water, and other kinds of nastiness almost suffocated
me in a minute. We had not proceeded far before we entered a
small apartment, hung round with damp and greasy canvas, which
made, on every hand, a most gloomy and frightful appearance. In
the middle stood a table of pine, varnished over with nasty slime,
furnished with a bottle of rum and an old tin mug with a hundred
and fifty bruises and several holes, through which the liquor
poured in as many streams. This was quickly filled with toddy and
as speedily emptied by two or three companions who presently
joined us in this doleful retreat. Not all the scenes of horror about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
us could afford me much dismay till I received the news that this
detestable apartment was allotted by the captain to be the place of
my habitation during the voyage!</p>

<p>"Our company continually increased, when the most shocking
oaths and curses resounded from every corner, some loading their
neighbors with bitter execrations, while others uttered imprecations
too awful to be recorded. The persons present were: first, the
captain's clerk, the young fellow who gave me the invitation. I
found him a person of considerable reading and observation who
had fled his native country on account of a young lady to whom he
was engaged. Second, was one John Tuzz, a midshipman and one
of my messmates, a good-natured, honest fellow, apt to blunder in
his conversation and given to extravagant profaneness. Third, one
Butler, a minister's son, who lived near Worcester, in England.
He was a descendant from Butler, the author of <cite>Hudibras</cite>, and
appeared to be a man of fine sense and considerable breeding, yet,
upon occasion, was extremely profane and immodest, yet nobody
seemed a greater admirer of delicacy in women than himself. My
fourth companion was one Spear, one of the mates, a most obliging
ingenious young gentleman, who was most tender of me in my
cruel sickness. Fifth: one of our company this evening was the
carpenter of the ship who looked like a country farmer, drank excessively,
swore roundly, and talked extravagantly. Sixth: was one
Shephard, an Irish midshipman, the greatest champion of profaneness
that ever fell under my notice. I scarce ever knew him to open
his mouth without roaring out a tumultuous volley of stormy oaths
and imprecations. After we had passed away an hour or two together,
Mr. Lisle, the lieutenant of marines, joined our company.
He was about fifty years of age, of gigantic stature, and quickly
distinguished himself by the quantities of liquor he poured down
his throat. He also was very profane.</p>

<p>"About nine o'clock the company began to think of supper, when
a boy was called into the room. Nothing in human shape did I ever
see before so loathsome and nasty. He had on his body a fragment
only of a check shirt, his bosom was all naked and greasy, over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
shoulders hung a bundle of woolen rags which reached in strings
almost down to his feet, and the whole composition was curiously
adorned with little shining animals. The boy no sooner made his
appearance than one of our society accosted him in this gentle language.
'Go you &mdash;&mdash; rascal, and see whether lobscouse is ready.'
Upon this the fellow began to mutter and scratch his head, but
after two or three hearty curses, went for the galley and presently
returned with an elegant dish which he placed on the table. It was
a composition of beef and onions, bread and potatoes, minced and
stewed together, then served up with its broth in a wooden tub, the
half of a quarter cask. The table was furnished with two pewter
plates, the half of one was melted away, and the other, full of
holes, was more weather-beaten than the sides of the ship; one
knife with a bone handle, one fork with a broken tine, half a metal
spoon and another, taken at Quebec, with part of the bowl cut off.
When supper was ended, the company continued their exercise of
drinking, swearing and carousing, till half an hour after two, when
some of these obliging gentlemen made a motion for my taking
some repose. Accordingly, a row of greasy canvas bags, hanging
overhead by the beams, were unlashed. Into one of them it was
proposed that I should get, in order to sleep, but it was with the
utmost difficulty I prevented myself from falling over on the other
side....</p>

<p>"The next day, towards evening, several passengers came on
board, viz: Mr. Barons, late Collector, Major Grant, Mr. Barons'
footman, and Mrs. Cruthers, the purser's wife, a native of New
England. After some considerable dispute, I had my lodgings fixed
in Mr. Pearson's berth, where Master Robant, Mr. Baron's man,
and I, agreed to lie together in one large hammock."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Such were the accommodations of the petty officers' mess on
board a twenty-gun ship of 1760 in the New England service.</p>

<p>In October, 1774, Miss Janet Schaw set sail from the Firth of
Forth, Scotland, in the brig <em>Jamaica Packet</em>, of eighty tons burden,
built in Massachusetts two years before. With her sailed a girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
friend, two young nephews, her brother and her maid. They arrived
on board in the evening and turned in at once. In Miss Schaw's
journal of the voyage, now in the British Museum, we read:</p>

<p>"Our Bed chamber, which is dignified with the title of <em>state
room</em>, [there were only two staterooms: the captain occupied the
other] is about five foot wide and six long; on one side is a bed
fitted up for Fanny and on the opposite side one for me. Poor
Fanny's is so very narrow, that she is forced to be tied on, or as the
Sea term is <em>lashed in</em>, to prevent her falling over. On the floor
below us lies our Abigail. As she has the breadth of both our Beds
and excellent Bedding, I think she has got a most envyable Berth,
but this is far from her opinion, and she has done nothing but
grumble about her accommodations." The two had been asleep
about an hour when her brother came to the stateroom and let
down "the half door" to enquire after their healths. His "Cott"
swung from the ceiling of the cabin of the brig and the two boys
slept on a mattress on the deck beneath the hammock. The hencoop
was located on deck just over his head and in the morning the
rooster and hens kept up such a pecking that it was impossible for
him to sleep. The brig was making a northerly course in a heavy sea
and Fanny and the maid were both seasick and lying flat on their
backs in their five by six foot cubicle, dimensions probably somewhat
underestimated by Miss Schaw, although later she records
that "we sit in bed till we dress, and get into it whenever we begin
to undress."</p>

<p>In the cabin, in which Schaw hung his "cott," was a small cast-iron
stove and here, too, was the case containing the Captain's gin,
which he frequently opened and the odor of which set their stomachs
topsy-turvy and sent poor Fanny to her bed, and Schaw flying
on deck for fresh air. This cabin was furnished with joint stools,
chests, table, and even an elbow chair which Miss Schaw had
lashed to a mooring near the fireside.</p>

<p>A few days after sailing the brig ran into a storm and the water
finding its way into the cabin almost reached the beds in the stateroom&mdash;(which
was located beside the companion stair)&mdash;forcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the maid to "peg in with the boys who could easily let her share
with them." The gale also washed away most of their private store
of provisions so they were forced to depend upon the ship's stores
which consisted mainly of neck-beef, several barrels of New England
pork, then on its third voyage across the Atlantic, oatmeal,
stinking herrings and excellent potatoes. Lobscouse was a favorite
dish made from salt beef that had been hung by a string over the
side of the ship till tolerably fresh and then cut up in little pieces
and stewed for some time with potatoes, onions and peppers. They
also varied their diet by "chowder, scratch-platter and stir-about."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Just forward of the cabin was the steerage filled with immigrants
of all ages. Their beds were made up on the deck where they lay
alongside of each other and in this low-studded space they existed
when the hatches were battened down in stormy weather. "They
have only for a grown person per week, one pound neck beef, or
spoilt pork, two pounds oat meal, with a small quantity of bisket,
not only mouldy, but absolutely crumbled down with damp, wet
and rottenness. The half is only allowed a child, so that if they had
not potatoes, it is impossible they could live out the voyage. They
have no drink, but a very small proportion of brakish bad water."</p>

<p>It is quite plain that eighteenth-century trans-Atlantic voyaging
was full of discomfort to the average traveler, and to the unfortunate
in the steerage a fearful adventure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">From Wampum To Paper Money</span></h3>


<p>The early settlers of New England had little coinage for
circulation and were driven to the necessity of using the
produce of the soil and the live stock from their pastures
as their media of exchange. Peltry also was one of the first and for
many years the principal article of currency. It was offered in great
abundance by the Indians who were very ready to barter it for
beads, knives, hatchets and blankets and especially for powder,
shot, guns and "strong water."</p>

<p>In most of the Colonies the wampum of the Indians also was extensively
used and frequently was paid into the treasury in payment
of taxes. So, also, were cattle and corn as is shown by numerous
enactments of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts
Bay. Musket balls were also current and were made legal
tender by order of the Court which decreed "that musket bullets
of a full bore shall pass current for a farthing a piece provided that
no man be compelled to take more than 12 pence at a time of
them." In Virginia, tobacco was used for currency and "from 100
to 150 pounds of it bought many a man a good wife."</p>

<p>The Indian wampum was perhaps the most convenient currency
available. It is described by Roger Williams who, perhaps, had a
better knowledge of it than most of the early colonists. He says:
"It is of two kinds which the Indians make of the stem or the stock
of the periwinkle after all the shell is broken off. [The periwinkle
is a mollusc, more common south of Cape Cod than along the
shores of Massachusetts Bay.] Of this kind, six of the small beads,
which they make with holes to string upon their bracelet, are current
with the English for a penny. The other kind is black, inclined
to a blue shade, which is made of the shell of a fish [that is, a
mollusc] which some of the English call henspoquahoc [now
known as the hen-clam or quahaug] and of this description three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
are equal to an English penny. One fathom of this stringed money
is worth five shillings."</p>

<p>To show the intimate relation of this Indian money to our early
history, it appears that even Harvard College accepted it for tuition
fees and otherwise; for in 1641 a trading company, chartered to
deal with the Indians in furs and wampum, was required to relieve
the College of its super-abundance of this odd currency and redeem
it, "provided they were not obliged to take more than &#163;25 of
it at any one time." The thrifty Dutch at New Amsterdam, however,
took advantage of the scarcity of legitimate currency and the
corresponding demand for wampum and established factories
where they made it in such vast quantities that the market was
broken and the value of wampum rapidly decreased.</p>

<p>The great source of metallic currency for New England in those
earliest days was the West India Islands and much silver brought
from there was later coined into "pine tree" shillings and sixpences.
Governor Winthrop, in 1639, tells of a "small bark from the West
Indies, one Capt. Jackson in her, with a commission from the Westminister
Company to take prizes from the Spanish. He brought
much wealth in money, plate, indigo and sugar." But metallic
money became so scarce that by 1640 there was but little in the
colonies and the greatest difficulty existed in making payments for
goods or the wages of servants. In one instance, in Rowley, "the
master was forced to sell a pair of his oxen to pay his servant's
wages and so told the servant he could keep him no longer, not
knowing how to pay him the next year. The servant answered him
that he would [continue to] serve him for more of his cattle. But
how shall I do, said the master, when all my cattle are gone? The
servant replied, why, then you shall serve me and you shall then
have your cattle again."</p>

<p>Various attempts were made to establish values to certain coins,
more or less ficticious, but this failed to relieve the situation and
finally, to obtain a more stable basis the Massachusetts General
Court adopted a currency of its own and the "pine tree" money appeared,
shortly preceded by the more rude and more easily counterfeited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
New England shillings and sixpences, that bore on one
side the letters "N. E." within a small circle and on the other side
the denomination in Roman numerals. These primitive coins were
made between 1650 and 1652 and were superseded by the true oak
and pine tree pieces after that date. The simple irregular form of
the "N. E." coins rendered them an easy prey to the counterfeiter
and the clipper, and the design of the newer coins, covering the
whole surface of the planchet, was a protection against both
dangers. The "N. E." shilling is now a rare coin and likewise the
sixpence, while the threepence is rarer still, but two or three genuine
examples being known to exist.</p>

<p>There are two distinct forms of the so-called "pine tree" currency,
the one bearing on the obverse a representation of a tree
resembling an oak, or as some say, a willow; the other with the true
pine-tree. It is thought that the ruder pieces bearing the oak tree
design were the first coined and that the more perfect pine tree
money was issued later. At any rate both "oak" and "pine tree"
pieces, shillings, sixpences and threepences, all bear the same date,
1652. But this money was issued continuously until 1686 without
a change of the date, it is said, to avoid interference from the English
government, the coining of money by the colonists being a distinct
violation of the royal prerogative. By the retention of the
original date it was thought to deceive the authorities at home into
the belief that the violation of the laws ceased as it began, in 1652.
In 1652, however, a two-penny piece was minted bearing the oak
tree design and hence it is natural to suppose that the pieces bearing
the true pine tree design were the last coined and not issued until
after 1662.</p>

<p>One of the traditions connected with the pine or oak tree money
is the story that Sir Thomas Temple, who was a real friend of the
colonists, in 1662, showed some of the pieces to the King at the
council table in London, when King Charles demanded upon what
authority these colonists had coined money anyway and sought to
have orders sent to prohibit any further issues. "But," responded
Sir Thomas, "this tree is the oak which saved your majesty's life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and which your loyal subjects would perpetuate." Sir Thomas of
course referred to the episode of Boscobel in which Charles II
escaped his enemies by hiding in the branches of an oak. This it is
said so pleased the King that he dropped the subject and the coining
of "pine tree" money proceeded merrily, as before, for twenty-five
years longer.</p>

<p>The master of the mint was John Hull who lived in Boston
where Pemberton Square now opens from Tremont Street and
where later was the famous garden and residence of Gardner
Green, Esq. The mint house, sixteen feet square and ten feet high,
was built on land belonging to Hull in the rear of his house. Robert
Sanderson, a friend of Hull, was associated with him in making the
"pine tree" money. It is not known how they divided their profit,
but they received one shilling sixpence for each twenty shillings
coined, and as it is estimated that "pine tree" money to the amount
of five millions of dollars in value was made during the thirty-four
years it was issued, the commissions received must have been very
large and the statement that the dowry, said to have been &#163;30,000,
given to Hull's daughter at her marriage, appears reasonable. That
the girl, plump as she is reported to have been, actually weighed
down the dowry in shillings, is, of course, absurd as that amount
in silver would weigh over 6,000 pounds rating a silver &#163; as weighing
4 oz. at that time.</p>

<p>Hawthorne's description of what is said to have taken place on
that occasion is too vivid a picture to be overlooked. He relates that
Captain John Hull was appointed to manufacture the pine tree
money and had about one shilling out of every twenty to pay him
for the trouble of making them. Hereupon all the old silver in the
colony was handed over to Captain John Hull. The battered silver
cans and tankards, I suppose, and silver buckles and broken spoons,
and silver hilts of swords that figured at court&mdash;all such articles
were doubtless thrown into the melting pot together.</p>

<p>The magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint-master
would have the best of the bargain and they offered him a large
sum of money if he would but give up that twentieth shilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
which he was continually dropping into his own pocket. But Captain
Hull declared himself perfectly satisfied with the shilling.
And well he might be, for so diligently did he labor that in a few
years, his pockets, his money bags, and his strong box were overflowing
with pine tree shillings.</p>

<p>Then Samuel Sewall, afterwards the famous Judge Sewall of
the days of witchcraft fame, came a courting to Hull's daughter.
Betsy was a fine and hearty damsel and having always fed heartily
on pumpkin pies, doughnuts, Indian puddings and other Puritan
dainties, she was as round and plump as a pudding herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may take her," said Captain Hull, to her lover, young
Sewall, "and you'll find her a heavy burden enough." Hawthorne
describes the wedding and the costumes of the contracting parties
and their friends, and Captain Hull he "supposes," rather improbably
one would think, however, "dressed in a plum colored coat
all the buttons of which were made of pine tree shillings. The buttons
of his waistcoat were of sixpences and the knees of his small
clothes were buttoned with silver three-pences ... and as to Betsy
herself, she was blushing with all her might, and looked like a
full-blown peony or a great red apple."</p>

<p>When the marriage ceremony was over, at a whispered word
from Captain Hull, a large pair of scales was lugged into the room,
such as wholesale merchants use for weighing bulky commodities,
and quite a bulky commodity was now to be weighed in them.
"Daughter Betsy," said the mint-master, "get into one side of these
scales." Miss Betsy&mdash;or Mrs. Sewall as we must now call her&mdash;did
as she was bid and again the servants tugged, this time bringing
in a huge iron-bound oaken chest which being opened proved to be
full to the brim with bright pine tree shillings fresh from the mint.
At Captain Hull's command the servants heaped double handfuls
of shillings into one side of the scales, while Betsy remained in the
other. Jingle, jingle, went the shillings as handful after handful
was thrown in, till, plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly
weighed the young lady from the floor. "There, son Sewall," cried
the honest mint-master, resuming his seat, "take these shillings for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
my daughter's portion. Use her kindly and thank Heaven for her.
It's not every wife that's worth her weight in silver."</p>

<p>However interesting the story may be of the plump girl sitting
in one pan of the scales as shillings were thrown into the other, as
depicted in Hawthorne's version of the affair, we must be permitted
to consider that time has cast a halo around the mint-master's
daughter and increased both her avoirdupois and her dowry.</p>

<p>Massachusetts was the only New England colony to coin silver
but close upon the date of the issue of the first "pine tree" money
came the Maryland shilling, sixpence, groat and penny, the last in
copper. These bear no date but appeared about 1659, the dies having
been made in England.</p>

<p>Numerous coins were later made in the colonies, either intended
for regular circulation or as tokens privately issued, among which
are the Granby coppers&mdash;rude half-pennies&mdash;made in 1737 by one
John Higley, the blacksmith, at Granby, Conn. They were made
of soft copper which was dug at Granby and are never found in
very good condition.</p>

<p>The word dollar is the English form of the German word
thaler, and the origin of the thaler is as follows: In the year 1519,
Count Schlick of Bohemia issued silver coins weighing one ounce
each and worth 113 cents. They were coined at Joachimsthal, that
is, James's Valley or dale, hence they became known as "Joachimsthalers,"
soon shortened to thalers. Through trade with the Dutch
these coins came into England in the sixteenth century and are
referred to sometimes as "dalers."</p>

<p>But the dollar came to the American continent not through the
Dutch or English but through the Spanish. This was due to the
extent of the Spanish Empire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
and also to the great quantities of silver which Spain drew
from her mines in Mexico and South America. The Spanish coin
was, strictly speaking, a peso, better known as a piece of eight, because
it was equal to eight reals (royals). As it was of the same
value, the name dollar was given to the piece of eight about the
year 1690.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The most famous Spanish dollar was known as the pillar dollar,
because it had on one side two pillars, representing the pillars of
Hercules, the classical name for the Straits of Gibralter, and this
Spanish dollar was common in America at the time of the War of
Independence.</p>

<p>In 1690 the treasury of the colony was so nearly exhausted that
the Great and General Court decided to issue promises to pay, the
first paper money minted by any Colony. The values were ten shillings,
one pound and five pounds. The occasion for this issue was
primarily the expenses of Governor Phips's expedition against
Quebec, which was thriftily expected to more than pay costs. The
French and Indians, however, were too strong for Sir William, and
the colonial treasury was faced with costs to the amount of &#163;50,000,
instead of the anticipated loot. These "Colony" or "Charter bills"
obtained a wide circulation and were called in annually and redeemed
and reissued as need arose, but after a few years, confidence
in them decreased and before long they passed at a discount
as great as 30 per cent.</p>

<p>In 1722, Massachusetts tried to relieve the scarcity of small
change by issuing five hundred pounds worth of tokens of the
value of one, two and three pence. They were printed on parchment
to make them more durable but apparently were not a success
as there were no more printed.</p>

<p>As the years went by, monetary conditions became more and
more unstable, and in 1740 an attempt was made to establish a
bank in the hope of placing the currency on a firmer basis. The
fight lay between a silver bank with bullion behind its notes and a
land bank issuing notes guaranteed by mortgages and manufactured
articles. These notes were to come due in twenty years and at
that time the holders instead of receiving coin might be forced to
take their pay in cast iron, bayberry wax, leather, cordwood, or
other articles of trade that might be difficult to dispose of. One of
these notes preserved in the cabinets of the Massachusetts Historical
Society has written on its back, in old-time handwriting, "A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Land Bank bill reserved as a specimen of ye mad humour among
many of ye people of ye Province, 1740."</p>

<p>Money matters now went from bad to worse. The value of silver
was called tenor. In 1740 silver was worth six shillings, eight pence
per ounce and in 1746 seven shillings, sixpence, and the buying
value of bills varied from year to year.</p>

<p>"Imagine having to keep in mind the relative values of bills of
old tenor, with silver at 6/8, or middle tenor; or new tenor firsts
at 6/8, but passing current at 7/8; or new tenor seconds, all of
which were laboring under fluctuating but constantly increasing
rates of depreciation, while there were also to be remembered Connecticut
bills of new tenor at 8/. and Rhode Island bills at 6/9 an
ounce, and also &#163;110,000 worth of private bills of the issue of
1733, which were worth a third more than the Colony bills, and
also &#163;120,000 in notes issued in 1740, "on a silver basis," to stifle
the land bank and equivalent to cash, and in addition "public bills
of the four promises at 29/. an ounce," whatever that means, and
you will not wonder that there was confusion worse confounded."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In 1749 Parliament voted to reimburse Massachusetts to the
amount of nearly one million dollars, for expenses incurred in the
expedition against Louisburg and this money was used to redeem
outstanding paper bills at the rate of ten in paper to one in cash.
The next year old tenor ceased to be lawful money amid general
rejoicing and much doggerel verse.</p>

<div class="poem">

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Herb Tea and the Doctor</span></h3>


<p>At a meeting of the Massachusetts Bay Company held in
London on March 5, 1628-29, it was proposed that the
Company "Intertayne a surgeon for the plantation" and
one Abraham Pratt was sent over soon after. He lived in Roxbury,
Charlestown and Cambridge. While returning to England with his
wife in the fall of 1644, their ship was wrecked on the coast of
Spain and both were drowned. At the same meeting the Company
selected a barber-surgeon, Robert Morley, to go to New England
and practice his calling on "aney of the Company that are planters
or there servants." In those days a barber-surgeon employed himself
in pulling teeth, bleeding and cupping.</p>

<p>Earlier than this, however, Doctor Samuel Fuller had come
over in the <em>Mayflower</em> and was of the greatest service to the sickly
foundation at Plymouth. When John Endecott's wife lay dying
at Naumkeak (Salem), in 1629, Doctor Fuller was hastily sent for,
and the next year he was called to Matapan (Dorchester) where
he "let some twenty of these people blood: [and] had conference
with them till I was weary."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> A month later he was at Charlestown
writing "I here but lose time and long to be at home, I can
do them no good, for I want drugs, and things fitting to work
with." Three years later he was dead of an infectious fever.</p>

<p>A large portion of the physicians in the early days of the Colony
were Puritan ministers who had studied medicine in England in
anticipation of removal to New England, as a hasty preparation
for such necessities as might arise. Each practised in his own flock
and Cotton Mather in his <em>Magnalia</em> (Book III, Chap. 26), speaks
of this union of the two professions as an "Angelical Conjunction."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
When Rev. Michael Wigglesworth died in 1705, his weeping
parishioners in the town of Malden, erected a stone to mark his
grave and on it may still be read the words</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Here lies intered in silent grave below<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Maulden's physician for soul and body two."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>In colonial times there was little regulation of medical practice,
although an ineffective law was passed in 1649. Any one might
come into a town and announce himself as a physician and if able
to cure patients of their maladies, his success was assured. Several
unfortunate failures, however, would seriously effect his standing.
As a natural result quacks appeared and disappeared in all the
larger towns.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, and later, there were two classes of
medical practitioners of which one prescribed vegetable substances
only, together with a free use of the lancet, and followed the teachings
of Galen, the Greek physician. The other school followed the
doctrines of Paracelsus and prescribed for the most part mineral
preparations, and oftentimes were styled "chemists." Of course
there was bitter rivalry between the two schools, each maintaining
so far as possible, a superstitious mystery concerning their profession.
There were few regular graduates from any recognized
medical school. Until after the Revolution most practitioners
gained their scanty store of medical knowledge by studying with
some family physician and in the homely school of experience.
Dr. William Douglas, a young Scotchman, began to practice in
Boston in 1716. In 1721 he wrote "we abound with Practitioners,
though no other graduate than myself. We have fourteen Apothecary
shops in Boston. All our Practitioners dispense their own
medicines.... In general the physical practise in our colonies is so
perniciously bad that excepting in surgery and in some very acute
cases, it is better to let nature under a proper regimen take her
course than to trust to the honesty and sagacity of the practitioner.
Our American practitioners are so rash and officious that the saying
in Ecclesiasticus may with much propriety be applied to them, 'He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
that sinneth before his Maker let him fall into the hands of the
physician.'"<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Governor John Winthrop was versed in medicine and his son,
John, Jr., and his grandson Wait Winthrop, both were proficient
in the profession. With Winthrop came Richard Palgrave and
William Gager, both physicians, and two years later arrived Giles
Firman, Jr., whose father was "a godly man, an apothecary of
Sudbury in England." Giles, Jr., studied at the University of
Cambridge and later settled at Ipswich, Mass., where he practiced
medicine, but found it "a meene helpe" and later studied theology
and eventually was ordained rector of Shalford, co. Essex, England.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the century there were two physicians practicing
in Boston, Dr. Thomas Oakes and Dr. Benjamin Bullivant,
of whom Dunton, the London bookseller gossiped in his "Letters
Written from New England."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Of Oakes he wrote that&mdash;</p>

<p>"His wise and safe Prescriptions have expell'd more Diseases
and rescu'd Languishing Patients from the Jaws of Death, than
Mountebanks and Quack-Salvers have sent to those dark Regions."</p>

<p>Concerning Dr. Bullivant he commented that&mdash;</p>

<p>"His Skill in Pharmacy was such, as rendered him the most compleat
Pharmacopean, not only in all Boston, but in all New England ... to
the Poor he always prescribes cheap, but wholesome
Medicines, not curing them of a Consumption in their Bodies, and
sending it into their Purses; nor yet directing them to the East
Indies to look for Drugs, when they may have far better out of
their Gardens."</p>

<p>Doctor John Clarke, said to have been a younger son of a good
family in the north of England, with a collegiate education, and
late of London, was granted a four-hundred acre farm in the town
of Newbury, in January, 1638, and September 28th, following,
the town also granted that</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Clarke in respect of his calling should be freed and exempted
from all public rates either for the country or the towne so
long as he shall remayne with us and exercise his calling among
us."</p>

<p>He exercised his calling in Newbury until 1647, when he removed
to Ipswich and two or three years later settled in Boston
where he died in 1664. Soon after removing to Boston he invented
a stove "for the saving of firewood &amp; warming of howses," which
the Great and General Court confirmed for a term of three years.
Nothing further is known of this invention and the fireplace persisted
until recent times.</p>

<p>When Doctor Clark removed from Newbury he was followed
by Dr. William Snelling who seems to have been a merry fellow
in times of drinking healths. On an occasion during the winter of
1651 he drank to his friends in the following toast,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"I'll pledge my friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And for my foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A plague for their heels<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And a pox for their toes,"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>which e'er long led to sorrowful acknowledgment of his weakness
before the Quarterly Court at Salem, and a fine of ten shillings
for cursing. This doubtless helped sustain the dignity of the Court
and strengthened virtue among the good men of the town of Newbury
at times when ribald mirth prevailed.</p>

<p>Dr. John Perkins who practised in Boston during the first half
of the eighteenth century, is said to have gone to London for two
year's study but his medical notebooks show that in his Boston
practise he prescribed for scrofula, syrup made of sow bugs
drowned in white wine. Castile soap boiled in strong beer he used
as a remedy for a "heavy load at the Stomac." For numb palsy he
prescribed "a bath of absinthe in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urina hominis</i>, used hot," and his
cure for a nervous weakness of the eyes was "shaving the head."
He noted that "Widow Alcock [died] of a hot bread supper. Jus.
Billings did so of eating Brown Bread for breakfast, a Thing he
never used before," and Reverend McGee's wife died by eating a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
supper of roast chickens at 13 days after childbirth and drinking
strong beer flip on it. "Wonderful that in learned and elevated situations
among ye great, should be such ignorance."</p>

<p>"Samuel Bent, Goldsmith, tender constitution and lax nerves,
upon a change of a linnen for a woolen cap to sleep in was affected
with a running of Bloody Water from ye nose, which staunched
when he wore linnen.</p>

<p>"Nathaniel Parkman's Daughter, scrophulously affected, had a
blow on the Head, on which the scrophula immediately left her
and Chorea St. Viti succeeded and followed her every Spring till
she turned consumptive and died."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Doctor Perkins was quite modern in some of his theories. He
entered in his notebook&mdash;</p>

<p>"Exercise is good [for pains in the stomach] in young girls and
others that use a sedentary life. So Sarah Bergers was cured by
learning country dances.</p>

<p>"Wheat, ye Shoemaker, was cured [of hemorrhoids] by taking
to ye portering with a wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>Doctor Ball of Northboro had a medicine called, "Receipt for
the Scratches. One Quart fishworms, washed clean; one pound
hog's lard stewed together, filtered through a strainer and add
one-half pint oil of turpentine; one-half pint good brandy. Simmer
it well and it is fit for use."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Obstetrics at that period was also a jolly pastime, as the doctor
and his volunteer assistants were regaled by a special brew known
as "groaning beer" and by freshly baked "groaning cakes."</p>

<p>In Salem lived Zerobabel Endecott, son of Governor John Endecott,
who practiced the healing art and who left behind him a
remarkable collection of medical recipes from which we include
selections illustrating the practice of the physician in colonial
days. His brother John, afterwards Governor of Connecticut, also
seems to have had some medical training as appears from a bill
preserved in the Massachusetts Archives, where under date of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
1668, he charged five shillings for "a Vomit and atendans" on one
John Clark, "weak and sike by reason of a scurvy and a dropsy."
Doctor Zerobabel died in 1684 and bequeathed to his son John,
who also was a physician and who died in England, "al my Instruments
and books both of phisicke and chirurgery." The inventory
of the estate shows "a case of lances, 2 Rasors, a box of Instruments,
10 bookes in folio, 16 in quarto, a saw with six Instruments
for a chirurgion and a chest of bookes &amp; writings."</p>

<p>Other Salem physicians were George Emery who settled in the
town in 1636 and sat on the gallows with a rope around his neck,
in 1668, for an unnatural crime; Rev. John Fiske, a graduate of
Cambridge, who had studied divinity and also physic, and came to
Salem in 1637; and Daniel Weld, who was chief surgeon during
the Narraganset campaign in King Philip's War; Col. Batholomew
Gedney, who left at his death drugs and instruments inventoried
at &#163;60; Dr. John Barton, who died of yellow fever; Dr. John
Swinnerton, made famous by Hawthorne's romance, and others
followed.</p>

<p>William Salmon, in his "Compendium of Physick," published
in London in 1671, estimates the necessary qualifications of the
seventeenth-century physician as follows: "He that would be an
accomplished physician, ought to be furnished with three things,
1. honesty and a good conscience; 2. a substantial, real, and well-grounded
understanding through the whole Art of Medicine;
3. with all such Instruments and Necessaries which are ordinarily
made use of in the performance of any medical operation," and
these instruments are listed as follows:</p>

<p>"The Parascuological Instruments, wherewith medicines are
prepared, whether Galenical or Chymical, are chiefly these: A
brass Kettle; an Alembick; a Circulatory; a Sieve; a Gourd; a
Balneum Mariae; Tongs; a Cauldron; a File; a Hippocras Bag;
an Iron Mortar; a Pestle; a Pitcher; a Marble; a glass Mortar and
Pestle; a Seperator; a Funnel; a Seirce; a Press; a Tile; a pair of
Sheers; Vials; Boxes; Crucibles; Gally-pots; Corks; Spoons;
Strainers; Retorts; Receivers; Bags; Spatulas; Weights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Scales; together with a Pair of Goldsmiths Bellows; and convenient
Furnaces fitted for any operation.</p>

<p>"The Chyrurgical Instruments with which the Artist ought to
be furnished, are chiefly these: A Plaister Box; an Uvula Spoon; a
Levatory; a Director; a pair of Forceps; a Spatula Lingua; an Incision
Knife; a pair of Scizzors; a Flame; a small Razour; a stitching
Quill; three square Needles; with a Case of good Launcets;
and a Salvatory; letting all be kept very sharp, clean and bright."</p>

<p>Who would know the virtues of the herbs and simples that grew
in the gardens of the Massachusetts Bay? Many herbals have been
compiled and printed, none more enticing than Nicholas Culpepper's
"English Herbals," more truly entitled "The English Physician
Enlarged," and first published in 1653. It had an enormous
sale. Since that year twenty-one different editions have served their
day, the last having been printed at Exeter, N.H., as late as 1824.</p>

<p>Culpepper, the son of a clergyman, was born in London in 1616
and died when only thirty-eight years old. In that short time, however,
he gained fame as a writer on astrology and medicine. At first
apprenticed to an apothecary, he later set up for himself as a
physician and acquired a high reputation among his patients.</p>

<p>In his catalogue of the simples he premises a few words to the
reader, viz.: "Let a due time be observed (cases of necessity excepted)
in gathering all Simples: for which take these few Rules. All
Roots are of most virtue when the Sap is down in them, viz. towards
the latter end of the summer, or beginning of the spring, for
happily in Winter many of them cannot be found: you may hang
up many of them a drying, by drawing a string through them, and
so keep them a whole year.</p>

<p>"Herbs are to be gathered when they are fullest of juyce, before
they run up to seeds; and if you gather them in a hot sunshine-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
they will not be so subject to putrifie: the best way to dry them, is
in the Sun, according to Dr. <em>Reason</em>, though not according to Dr.
<em>Tradition</em>: Such Herbs as remain green all the year, or are very
full of juyce, it were a folly to dry at all, but gather them only for
present use, as Houseleek, Scurvy-grass, etc.</p>

<p>"Let flowers be gathered when they are in their prime, in a sunshine-day,
and dryed in the sun. Let seeds be perfectly ripe before
they be gathered.</p>

<p>"Let them be kept in a dry place: for any moysture though it be
but a moist ayr, corrupts them, which if perceived in time, the
beames of the Sun will refresh them again."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Ageratum</em> dryes the brain, helps the green sickness, and profit
such as have a cold or weak Liver: outwardly applyed, it takes away
the hardnesse of the matrix, and fills hollow ulcers with flesh.</p>

<p><em>Anemone.</em> The juyce snuffed up the nose purgeth the head, it
clenseth filthy ulcers, encreaseth milk in Nurses, and outwardly by
oyntments helps Leprosies.</p>

<p><em>Asphodel or Daffodil.</em> I know no physicall use of the roots, probably
there is: for I do not believe God created anything of no use.</p>

<p><em>Balm</em>, outwardly mixed with salt and applied to the neck, helps
the Kings Evil, biting of mad dogs and such as cannot hold their
necks as they should do; inwardly it is an excellent remedy for a
cold, cheers the heart, takes away sorrow, and produces mirth.</p>

<p><em>Basil</em> gives speedy deliverance to women in travail.</p>

<p><em>Bedstraw.</em> Stancheth blood: boyled in oyl is good to annoynt a
weary traveller: inwardly it provokes lust.</p>

<p><em>Borrage</em>, cheers the heart and drooping spirits, helps swooning
and heart qualms.</p>

<p><em>Briony</em>, both white and black, they purg the flegm and watry
humors, but they trouble the stomack much, they are very good for
dropsies: the white is most in use, and is admirable good for the
fits of the mother; both of them externally used, take away
Freckles, Sun-burning, and Morphew from the face, and clense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
filthy ulcers: It is a churlish purge, and being let alone, can do no
harm.</p>

<p><em>Buglosse.</em> Continual eating of it makes the body invincible
against the poyson of Serpents, Toads, Spiders, etc. The rich may
make the Flowers into a conserve, and the herb into a syrup: the
poor may keep it dry: both may keep it as a Jewell.</p>

<p><em>Burdoc or Clot-bur</em>, helps such as spit blood and matter, bruised
and mixed with salt and applyed to the place, helps the biting of
mad dogs. It expels wind, easeth paines of the teeth, strengthens
the back ... being taken inwardly.</p>

<p><em>Celondine.</em> The root is manifestly hot and dry, clensing and
scouring, proper for such as have the yellow Jaundice, it opens the

bladder as grows upon the earth. It expels wind, belchings, used in

swelling and comforts the sinews much, and therfore is good for

good against the Shingles, and appeaseth the rage of any fretting

<p><em>Hellebore.</em> The root of white Hellebore, or sneezwort, being
grated &amp; snuffed up the nose, causeth sneezing, Kills Rats and

<p><em>Spinage.</em> I never read any physicall virtues of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Spleenwort</em> is excellent good for melancholy people, helps the
stranguary and breaks the Stone in the bladder. Boyl it and drink
the decoction; but because a little boyling will carry away the
strength of it in vapours, let it boyl but very little, and let it stand
close stopped till it be cold before you strain it out; this is the generall
rule for all Simples of this nature.</p>

<p><em>Spurge.</em> Better let alone that taken inwardly; hair anoynted with
the juyce of it will fall off: it kills fish, being mixed with anything
they will eat, outwardly it takes away Freckles and sunburning.</p>

remedy for old headache. It clears the skin and causeth a lovely
color.</p>

<p><em>Wake-Robins</em> or <em>Cuckow-pints</em>. I know no great good they doe
inwardly taken, unlesse to play the rogue withall, or make sport;
outwardly applyed they take off Scurf, Morphew, or Freckles
from the face, cleer the skin, and cease the pain of the Gout.</p>

<p><em>Water-Lilies.</em> The roots stop lust. I never dived so deep to find
any other virtue.</p>

<p><em>Wood Bettony</em> helps the falling sickness, and all headaches comming
of cold, procures apetite, helps sour belchings, helps cramps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and convulsions, helps the Gout, Kills worms, helps bruises, and
cleanseth women after their labor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Crimes and Punishments</span></h3>


<p>The men who controlled the affairs of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony at the time of its founding, determined not
only that the churches, but that the government of the
commonwealth they were creating, should be based strictly upon
the teachings of the Bible. The charter provided that the Governor,
Deputy Governor and Assistants might hold courts "for the better
ordering of affairs," and so for the first ten years, the Court of
Assistants, as it was styled, exercised the entire judicial powers of
the colony. Its members were known as the magistrates. During
this period but few laws or orders were passed. When complaints
were made, the court, upon a hearing, determined whether the
conduct of the accused had been such as in their opinion to deserve
punishment, and if it had been, then what punishment should be
inflicted. This was done without any regard to English precedents.
There was no defined criminal code, and what constituted a crime
and what its punishment, was entirely within the discretion of the
court. If in doubt as to what should be considered an offence, the
Bible was looked to for guidance. The General Court itself, from
time to time, when in doubt, propounded questions to the ministers
or elders, which they answered in writing, much as the Attorney
General or the Supreme Judicial Court at the present day may
advise.</p>

<p>But the people soon became alarmed at the extent of personal
discretion exercised by the magistrates and so, in 1635, the freemen
demanded a code of written laws and a committee composed of
magistrates and ministers was appointed to draw up the same. It
does not appear that much was accomplished although Winthrop
records that Mr. Cotton of the committee, reported "a copy of
Moses his judicials, compiled in an exact method, which was taken
into further consideration till the next general court." The "judicials,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
however, never were adopted. In 1639 another committee
was directed to peruse all the "models" which had been or should be
presented, "draw them up into one body," and send copies to the
several towns. This was done. In October, 1641, action was taken
which led to a definite and acceptable result. Rev. Nathaniel Ward
of Ipswich, who had been educated for the law and had practiced
in the courts of England, was requested to furnish a copy of the
liberties, etc. and nineteen transcriptions were sent to the several
towns in the Colony. Two months later at the session of the General
Court, this body of laws was voted to stand in force.</p>

<p>This code, known as "the Body of Liberties," comprised about
one hundred laws, civil and criminal. The civil laws were far in
advance of the laws of England at that time, and in substance were
incorporated in every subsequent codification of the laws of the
Colony. Some of them are in force today, and others form the basis
of existing laws. The criminal laws were taken principally from the
Mosaic code and although many of them may seem harsh and
cruel yet, as a whole, they were much milder than the criminal laws
of England at that time. No reference was made to the common
law of England. All legislation in regard to offences was based
upon the Bible, and marginal references to book, chapter and verse
were supplied to guide future action. This Code served its intended
purpose well and remained in force until the arrival of the Province
charter in 1692 save during the short period of the Andros
administration.</p>

<p>The judiciary system of the Colony therefore provided for the
following courts:</p>

<p>First, the Great and General Court which possessed legislative
powers and limited appellate authority from the Court of Assistants.</p>

<p>Second, the Court of Assistants&mdash;a Supreme Court or Court of
Appeals that had exclusive jurisdiction in all criminal cases extending
"to life, limb, or banishment," jurisdiction in civil cases in
which the damages amounted to more than &#163;100., and appellate
jurisdiction from the County Quarterly Courts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Third, County or Inferior Quarterly Courts that had jurisdiction
in all cases and matters not reserved to the Court of Assistants
or conferred upon commissioners of small causes. These courts also
laid out highways, licensed ordinarys, saw that an able ministry was
supported, and had general control of probate matters, and in 1664
were authorized to admit freemen.</p>

<p>The juries were made judges of the law and the fact and when
upon a trial there was insufficient evidence to convict, juries were
authorized to find that there were strong grounds of suspicion, and
accordingly sentence afterwards was given by the Court. In order
to facilitate court proceedings an excellent law was passed in 1656
which authorized the fining of a person 20 shillings an hour for
any time occupied in his plea in excess of one hour.</p>

<p>John Winthrop with his company arrived at Salem in June,
1630, and ten weeks later the first court in the Colony was held at
Charlestown. The maintenance of the ministry was the first concern,
to be followed by an order regulating the wages of carpenters,
bricklayers, thatchers and other building trades. Thomas Morton
at "Merry Mount" was not forgotten for he was to be sent for "by
processe," and a memorandum is entered to obtain for the next
Court an estimate "of the charges that the Governor hathe beene
att in entertaineing several publique persons since his landing in
Newe England."</p>

<p>At the second meeting of the Court of Assistants, three of the
magistrates were fined a noble apiece for being late at Court and
three weeks later Sir Richard Saltonstall, because of absence, was
fined four bushels of malt. It was at this Court that Thomas
Morton was ordered "sett into the bilbowes" and afterwards sent
prisoner into England by the ship called the <em>Gifte</em>. His goods were
ordered seized and his house burnt to the ground "in the sight of
the Indians for their satisfaction, for many wrongs he hath done
them from time to time." Several towns were christened the names
by which they are still known, and those who had ventured to plant
themselves at Aggawam, now Ipswich, were commanded "forthwith
to come away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Aside from Morton's offences at Mount Wollaston, nothing of
a criminal nature seems to have been brought to the attention of
the Court until its third session on September 28th. To be sure the
Governor had been consulted by the magistrates of the Colony at
Plymouth concerning the fate of one John Billington of Plymouth
who had murdered his companion John New-Comin. Billington
was hanged, and "so the land was purged from blood."</p>

<p>Unless murder may have been committed at an earlier date by a
member of some crew of unruly fishermen along the coast, this
was the first murder committed in the English settlements about
the Massachusetts Bay. But unfortunately it was not the last.
Walter Bagnell's murder in 1632 was followed by that of John
Hobbey and Mary Schooley in 1637, and the next year Dorothy,
the wife of John Talbie, was hanged for the "unnatural and untimely
death of her daughter Difficult Talby." The daughter's
christian name at once suggests unending possibilities.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1646 a case of infanticide was discovered in
Boston. A daughter of Richard Martin had come up from Casco
Bay to enter into service. She concealed her condition well and
only when accused by a prying midwife was search made and the
fact discovered. She was brought before a jury and caused to touch
the face of the murdered infant, whereupon the blood came fresh
into it. She then confessed. Governor Winthrop relates that at her
death, one morning in March, "after she was turned off and had
hung a space, she spake, and asked what they did mean to do. Then
some stepped up, and turned the knot of the rope backward, and
then she soon died."</p>

<p>This curious "ordeal of touch" had also been applied the previous
year at Agamenticus on the Maine Coast when the wife of one
Cornish, whose bruised body had been found in the river, with her
suspected paramour, was subjected to this supreme test. It is recorded
that the body bled freely when they approached which
caused her to confess not only murder but adultery, both of which
crimes were punishable by death. She was hanged.</p>

<p>Probably the last instance in Massachusetts when this "ordeal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
touch" was inflicted, occurred in a little old meetinghouse in the
parish of West Boxford, in Essex County, one July day in the year
1769. The previous December, Jonathan Ames had married Ruth,
the eldest daughter of the widow Ruth Perley. He took his bride
to the house of his parents, some five miles distant, and lived there.
As in some instances since that time, the mother-in-law soon proved
to be not in full sympathy with the young bride living under her
roof. In May a child was born and a few days after the young
mother died under circumstances which caused suspicion in the
neighborhood. The body was hastily buried, none of the neighbors
were invited to be present, and soon, about the parish, were flying
rumors, which a month later crystalized into a direct accusation and
a coroner's inquest. It was held in the meetinghouse that formerly
stood in the sandy pasture near the old cemetery. The Salem newspaper
records that the building was "much thronged by a promiscuous
multitude of people."</p>

<p>The court opened with prayer, the coroners then gave the jury
"their solemn charge" and then the entire company proceeded,
"with decency and good order," over the winding roadway up the
hill to the burying ground, where for five weeks had lain the body
of the young bride. During the exhumation the crowd surged
around the grave so eagerly that they were only held in check by
the promise that all should have an opportunity to inspect the remains.
The autopsy at the meetinghouse resulted in a report from
the jury that Ruth Ames "came to her death by Felony (that is to
say by poison) given to her by a Person or Persons to us unknown
which murder is against the Peace of our said Lord the King, his
Crown and Dignity." When it was found that no sufficient evidence
could be adduced to hold either the husband of the murdered girl,
or his mother, then was demanded an exhibition of that almost forgotten
"ordeal of touch." The body was laid upon a table with a
sheet over it and Jonathan and his mother were invited to prove
their innocence by this gruesome test. The superstition required the
suspected party to touch the neck of the deceased with the index
finger of the left hand. Blood would immediately follow the touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of the guilty hand, the whiteness of the sheet of course making it
plainly visible. Both mother and son refused to accept the ordeal.
Whether or no they believed in the superstition, we never shall
learn. Fear may have held them motionless before the accusing
eyes. Certainly the nervous tension at such a time must have been
very great.</p>

<p>The <cite>Gazette</cite> states that the examination gave great occasion
to conclude that they were concerned in the poisoning, and a week
after the inquest they were arrested and confined in the ancient
jail in Salem where the persons accused of witchcraft were imprisoned
many years before. They were indicted and brought to
trial. John Adams, afterwards President of the United States, then
thirty-four years of age, was counsel for the accused. Jonathan
Ames turned King's evidence against his mother. It was midnight
before the counsel began their arguments and two of the three
judges were explicit in summing up the evidence, that there was "a
violent presumption" of guilt, but at nine o'clock in the morning
the jury came in and rendered a verdict of "not guilty." May the
result be attributed to John Adams's eloquence and logic or to the
vagaries of our jury system?</p>

<p>But we are a long way from the third session of the Court of
Assistants held September 28, 1630. Not until this time did the
law begin to reach out for its victims. John Goulworth was ordered
whipped and afterwards set in the stocks for felony, not named.
One other was whipped for a like offence and two Salem men, one
of whom has given us an honored line of descendants, were sentenced
to sit in the stocks for four hours, for being accessory thereunto.
Richard Clough's stock of strong water was ordered seized
upon, because of his selling a great quantity thereof to servants,
thereby causing much disorder. No person was to permit any Indian
to use a gun under a penalty of &#163;10. Indian corn must not be sold
or traded with Indians or sent away without the limits of the
Patent. Thomas Gray was enjoined to remove himself out of the
Patent before the end of March, and the oath was administered to
John Woodbury, the newly elected constable from Salem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>At the next session William Clark, who had been brought to
book at a previous Court for overcharging Mr. Baker for cloth,
now was prohibited cohabitation and frequent keeping company
with Mrs. Freeman and accordingly was placed under bonds for a
future appearance. Three years later this offender became one of
the twelve who went to Agawam and founded the present town of
Ipswich, and ten years later still another William Clark of Ipswich
was sentenced to be whipped "for spying into the chamber of
his master and mistress and reporting what he saw."</p>

<p>November 30, 1630, Sir Richard Saltonstall was fined &#163;5, for
whipping two persons without the presence of another assistant, as
required by law; while Bartholomew Hill was whipped for stealing
a loaf of bread, and John Baker suffered the same penalty for
shooting at wild fowl on the Sabbath Day. And so continues the
record of intermingled punishment and legislation.</p>

<p>The struggling communities that had planted themselves along
the shores of the Massachusetts Bay largely had refused to conform
to the rules and ordinances of the English Church. If the
records of the Quarterly Courts are studied it will be seen that the
settlers also failed to obey the rules and laws laid down by the
magistrates of their own choosing. To be sure there were large
numbers of indentured servants and the rough fishermen along the
coastline have always been unruly. Much also may be attributed
to the primitive and congested life in the new settlements. Simple
houses of but few rooms and accommodating large families, surely
are not conducive to gentle speech or modesty of manners nor to
a strict morality. The craving desire for land holding, and the
poorly defined and easily removed bounds naturally led to frequent
actions for trespass, assault, defamation, slander and debt.
The magistrates exercised unusual care in watching over the religious
welfare of the people and in providing for the ministry.
It has been stated frequently that in the olden times everyone went
to church. The size of the meetinghouses, the isolated location of
many of the houses, the necessary care of the numerous young
children, and the interesting side lights on the manners of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
times which appear in the court papers, all go to prove that the
statement must not be taken literally. Absence from meeting,
breaking the Sabbath, carrying a burden on the Lord's Day, condemning
the church, condemning the ministry, scandalous falling
out on the Lord's Day, slandering the church, and other misdemeanors
of a similar character were frequent. A number of years
before the Quakers appeared in the Colony it was no unusual matter
for some one to disturb the congregation by public speeches
either in opposition to the minister or to some one present. Zaccheus
Gould, a very large landholder, in Topsfield, in the time of the
singing the psalm one Sabbath afternoon sat himself down upon
the end of the table about which the minister and the chief of the
people sat, with his hat on his head and his back toward all the rest
of them that sat about the table and although spoken to altered
not his posture; and the following Sabbath after the congregation
was dismissed he haranged the people and ended by calling
goodman Cummings a "proud, probmatical, base, beggarly, pick
thank fellow." Of course the matter was ventilated in the Salem
Court.</p>

<p>At the February 29, 1648, session of the Salem Court eight
cases were tried. A Gloucester man was fined for cursing, saying,
"There are the brethren, the divil scald them." Four servants were
fined for breaking the Sabbath by hunting and killing a raccoon in
the time of the public exercise to the disturbance of the congregation.
If the animal had taken to the deep woods instead of staying
near the meetinghouse the servants might have had their fun without
paying for it. A Marblehead man was fined for sailing his boat
loaded with hay from Gloucester harbor, on the Lord's Day, when
the people were going to the morning exercise. Nicholas Pinion,
who worked at the Saugus Iron works, was presented for absence
from meeting four Lord's Days together, spending his time drinking,
and profanely; and Nicholas Russell of the same locality was
fined for spending a great part of one Lord's day with Pinion in
drinking strong water and cursing and swearing. He also had been
spending much time with Pinion's wife, causing jealousy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
family; and the lady in question, having broken her bond for good
behavior, was ordered to be severely whipped. The other cases were
for swearing, in which the above named lady was included; for
being disguised with drink; and for living from his wife. And so
the Court ended.</p>

<p>A curious instance of Sabbath breaking occurred at Hampton in
1646. Aquila Chase and his wife and David Wheeler were presented
at Ipswich Court for gathering peas on the Sabbath. They
were admonished. The family tradition has it that Aquila returned
from sea that morning and his wife, wishing to supply a delicacy
for dinner, fell into grave error in thus pandering to his unsanctified
appetite.</p>

<p>While we are discussing matters relating to the Sabbath and to
the church it may be well to allude to the ministry. It has been
shown that the first concern of the Court of Assistants was a provision
for the housing and care of the ministry. Much the larger number
were godly men actuated by a sincere desire to serve their people
and to preserve their souls. But many of them were men, not saints,
and so possessed of men's passions and weaknesses. While all exercised
more or less influence over the communities in which they lived,
yet the tangible result must have been negative in some instances.
Take for example the small inland town of Topsfield, settled
about 1639. Rev. William Knight rendered mission service for a
short time early in the 40's and a dozen years later Rev. William
Perkins moved into town from Gloucester. He had been one of the
twelve who settled the town of Ipswich in 1633; afterwards he
lived at Weymouth where he was selectman, representative to the
General Court, captain of the local military company and also a
member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company. He
also was schoolmaster in 1650 and the next year appears at Gloucester
as minister, from which place he soon drifted into Court. Cross
suits for defamation and slander were soon followed by the presentment
of Mrs. Holgrave for unbecoming speeches against Mr.
Perkins, saying "if it were not for the law, shee would never come
to the meeting, the teacher was so dead ... affirming that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
teacher was fitter to be a ladys chamberman, than to be in the
pulpit."</p>

<p>Mr. Perkins removed to Topsfield in 1656. The next year he
tried to collect his salary by legal process and again in 1660. Three
years later a church was organized and their first minister was settled.
He was a Scotchman&mdash;Rev. Thomas Gilbert. Soon Mr. Perkins
was summoned to Salem Court where Edward Richards declared
in court before Mr. Perkins' face, that the latter being asked
whither he was going, said, to hell, for aught he knew. Of course
Mr. Perkins denied the testimony. Later in the same year he was
fined for excessive drinking, it appearing that he stopped at the
Malden ordinary and called for sack. But goody Hill told him that
he had had too much already and Master Perkins replied, "If you
think I am drunk let me see if I can not goe," and he went tottering
about the kitchen and said the house was so full of pots and
kettles that he could hardly go.</p>

<p>But what of Mr. Gilbert. Three years after his settlement Mr.
Perkins appeared in Court and presented a complaint in twenty-seven
particulars "that in public prayers and sermons, at several
times he uttered speeches of a high nature reproachful and scandalous
to the King's majestie &amp; his government." He was summoned
into Court and bound over in &#163;1000 to the next General
Court where eventually he was solemnly admonished publicly in
open court by the Honored Governor. With twenty-seven particulars,
could a Scotchman restrain his tongue? Mr. Gilbert could
not, and shortly Mr. Perkins brought two complaints of defamation
of character. Mr. Gilbert also soon developed a love of wine
for it appears by the court papers that one sacrament day, when
the wine had been brought from the meetinghouse and poured into
the golden cup, Mr. Gilbert drank most of it with the usual result,
for he sank down in his chair, forgot to give thanks, and sang a
Psalm with lisping utterance. He was late at the afternoon service,
so that many went away before he came and Thomas Baker testified
"I perceived that he was distempered in his head, for he did
repeat many things many times over; in his prayer he lisped and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
when he had done to prayer, he went to singing &amp; read the Psalm
so that it could not be well understood and when he had done singing
he went to prayer again, and when he had done he was going
to sing again, but being desired to forbear used these expressions:
I bless God I find a great deal of comfort in it; and coming out of
the pulpit he said to the people I give you notice I will preach
among you no more." His faithful wife testified that his conduct
was due to a distemper that came upon him sometimes when fasting
and in rainy weather. The following April he was again before
the Court charged with many reproachful and reviling speeches
for which he was found guilty and sharply admonished and plainly
told "that if he shall find himself unable to demean himself more
soberly and christianly, as became his office, they do think it more
convenient for him to surcease from the exercise of any public
employment." The stubborn Scot refused to submit and affixing a
defiant paper to the meetinghouse door he deserted his office for
three successive Sabbaths, when his exasperated people petitioned
the Court to be freed from such "an intollerable burden" and so
the relation ceased but not until further suits and counter suits had
been tried for defamation, slander, and threatened assault.</p>

<p>His successor was Rev. Jeremiah Hobart, a Harvard graduate,
who preached for a while at Beverly and found difficulty in collecting
his salary. He remained at Topsfield eight years and during
that time became a familiar figure at the County Courts, because of
non-payment of salary, for cursing and swearing, and for a damaging
suit for slander exhibiting much testimony discreditable to him.
Even his brother ministers and the churches were not free from his
reproachful and scandalous speeches so he at last was dismissed and
two years later was followed by a godly man, Rev. Joseph Capen
of Dorchester, who enjoyed a peaceful pastorate of nearly forty
years.</p>

<p>The severe penalties of the English legal code were much modified
in the Bay Colony but public executions continued until the middle
of the nineteenth century and were usually more or less a public
holiday. The condemned was taken in a cart through the streets to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the gallows. Not infrequently a sermon was preached by some minister
on the Sunday previous to the execution and speeches from the
gallows always thrilled the crowd. The execution of pirates drew
many people from some distance. Several Rhode Island murderers
were executed and afterwards hung in chains. The gibbeting of the
bodies of executed persons does not seem to have been general.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>While executions by burning took place in Europe, and Salem is
sometimes accused of having burned witches at the stake, there are
but two instances, so far as known, when this extreme penalty was
inflicted in Massachusetts. The first occurred in 1681 when Maria,
the negro servant of Joshua Lamb of Roxbury willfully set fire to
her master's house, and was sentenced by the Court to be burned
alive. The same year Jack, a negro servant, while searching for food
set fire to the house of Lieut. William Clark of Northampton. He
was condemned to be hanged and then his body was burnt to ashes
in the same fire with Maria, the negress. The second instance of
inflicting the penalty of burning alive occurred at Cambridge in
the fall of 1755, when Phillis, a negro slave of Capt. John Codman
of Charlestown, was so executed. She poisoned her master to
death by using arsenic. A male slave Mark, who was an accomplice
was hanged and the body afterwards suspended in chains beside the
Charlestown highway where it remained for nearly twenty years,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Why was the woman deemed more culpable than the man in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
instances of poisoning? The old English law so provided and at a
later date, under Henry VIII, poisoners were boiled alive in oil.
The last execution in Massachusetts for the crime of arson occurred
on Salem Neck in 1821 when Stephen Merrill Clark, a Newburyport
lad, fifteen years of age, paid the penalty. He had set fire to
a barn in the night time endangering a dwelling house.</p>

<p>Ten years before the adoption of the "Body of Liberties,"
adultery became a capital crime in accordance with the Mosaic law.
The first case was one John Dawe, for enticing an Indian woman.
He was severely whipped, and at the next session of the General
Court, the death penalty was ordered for the future. When we
consider the freedom of manners of the time, the clothing worn by
the women, the limited sleeping accommodations and the ignorance
of the servants, it is remarkable that the penalty was inflicted in so
few cases. The records are full of cases of fornication, uncleanness,
wanton dalliance, unseemly behaviour, unchaste words, and living
away from wife, and the more so during the earlier years. Possibly,
the juries may have thought the penalty too severe and found the
parties guilty only, of "adulterous behavior," which happened in
Boston in 1645. This followed a case of the previous year where a
young woman had married an old man out of pique and then received
the attentions of a young man of eighteen. They both were
hanged.</p>

<p>The Court Records of the County of Essex always must have a
curious interest because of the witchcraft cases. But the first execution
in Massachusetts for witchcraft did not take place in Salem,
but in Boston, in 1648, when Margaret Jones of Charlestown was
hanged. It was shown that she had a malignant touch, that she produced
deafness, practiced physic, and that her harmless medicines
produced violent effects. She foretold things which came to pass
and lied at her trial and railed at the jury. The midwives found
that mysterious excrescence upon her, and for all these crimes she
was hanged, and as a proof from Heaven of the justice of her
taking off there was a great tempest in Connecticut on the very
hour she was executed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>But Essex County court records show several witchcraft cases
during the first twenty-five years following the settlement. In
September, 1650, Henry Pease of Marblehead, deposed that he
heard Peter Pitford of Marblehead say that goodwife James was
a witch and that he saw her in a boat at sea in the likeness of a cat,
and that his garden fruits did not prosper so long as he lived near
that woman, and that said Pitford often called her "Jesable."
Erasmus James, her husband, promptly brought suit for slander,
and at the next Court another suit for defamation by which he received
50s. damages. The court records show that this Jane James
had previously made her appearance, for in June, 1639, Mr.
Anthony Thatcher complained that she took things from his
house. She and her husband were bound for her good behavior and
"the boys to be whipped by the Governor of the Family where
they had offended." Six years later, in September, 1645, John
Bartoll said in open court that he could "prove Jane James a common
lyer, a theif &amp; a false forsworn woman," and a year later, in
September, 1646, Thomas Bowen, and his wife, Mary, testified
that Jane James spoke to William Barber in Bowen's house in
Marblehead and Barber said, "get you out of doors you filthy old
Baud or else I will cuttle your hide, you old filthy baggage," &amp; he
took up a firebrand but did not throw it at her. Peter Pitford's accusation
was not the only one for in the following year John Gatchell
said that Erasmus James's wife was an old witch and that he had
seen her going in a boat on the water toward Boston, when she was
in her yard at home. But Erasmus promptly brought suit in the
Salem court and recovered a verdict in his favor.</p>

<p>There are several other cases before 1655. In October, 1650,
Thomas Crauly of Hampton sued Ralph Hall for slander, for saying
he had called Robert Sawyer's wife a witch.</p>

<p>John Bradstreet, a young man of Rowley, was presented at
Court in 1652 for having familiarity with the devil, witnesses testifying
that Bradstreet said that he read in a book of magic and that
he heard a voice asking him what work he had for him to do, and
Bradstreet answered "go make a bridge of sand over the sea, go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
make a ladder of sand up to Heaven and go to God and come
down no more." There was much palaver but the Court showed
common sense and Bradstreet was ordered to be fined or whipped
for telling a lie.</p>

<p>In 1653 Christopher Collins of Lynn brought suit against Enoch
Coldan for slander, for saying that Collins' wife was a witch and
calling her a witch. The judgment however was for the defendant.
Another accusation was promptly squelched in the fall of the same
year.</p>

<p>Edmond Marshall of Gloucester unwisely stated publicly that
Mistress Perkins, Goodey Evans, Goodey Dutch and Goodey
Vincent were under suspicion of being witches. Their husbands at
once brought suit for defamation of character and the verdict in
each case was, that the defendant should make public acknowledgment
within fourteen days in the meetinghouses at Salem, Ipswich
and Gloucester.</p>

<p>To sentence a culprit to expiate his crime before the congregation
in the meetinghouse was a common thing. The publicity, in theory,
induced shame and thus served as a future deterrent. To sit in the
stocks and then make public acknowledgment before the congregation
was a favorite penalty. Sometimes the offender was ordered
to stand at the church door with a paper on his hat inscribed with
the crime he had committed. If for lying, a cleft stick might ornament
his tongue. Whipping was the most frequent penalty, closely
followed by the stocks, and after a time imprisonment became more
common. The bilboes were used only in the earliest period. The
use of the stocks and whipping post was discontinued in 1813 and
not a single example seems to have survived in either museum or
attic. The pillory was in use in State Street, Boston, as late as 1803,
and two years before, John Hawkins stood one hour in the pillory
in what is now Washington Street, Salem, and afterwards had one
ear cropped&mdash;all for the crime of forgery. Branding the hand or
cheek was also inflicted, and Hawthorne has made famous another
form of branding, the wearing prominently upon the clothing, an
initial letter of a contrary color, symbolizing the crime committed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
This penalty was inflicted upon a man at Springfield, as late as October
7, 1754, and the law remained in force until February 17,
1785. As early as 1634 a Boston drunkard was sentenced to wear a
red D about his neck for a year.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Massachusetts did not purge her laws from these ignominous
punishments until 1813 when whipping, branding, the stocks, the
pillory, cutting off ears, slitting noses, boring tongues, etc., were
done away with.</p>

<p>There lived in Salem, nearly three centuries ago, a woman whose
story is told by Governor Winthrop and the records of the Quarterly
Courts. She was, in a sense, a forerunner of Anne Hutchinson
and we may fancy at heart a suffragette. Her story gives you an
outline picture of the manners of the times in a few details. Her
name was Mary Oliver and her criminal record begins in June,
1638. Governor Winthrop relates: "Amongst the rest, there was a
woman in Salem, one Oliver, his wife, who had suffered somewhat
in England by refusing to bow at the name of Jesus, though otherwise
she was conformable to all their orders. She was (for ability of
speech, and appearance of zeal and devotion) far before Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Hutchinson, and so the fitter instrument to have done hurt, but
that she was poor and had little acquaintance. She took offence at
this, that she might not be admitted to the Lord's supper without
giving public satisfaction to the church of her faith, etc., and covenanting
or professing to walk with them according to the rule of
the gospel; so as upon the sacrament day she openly called for it,
stood to plead her right, though she were denied; and would not
forbear, before the magistrate, Mr. Endecott, did threaten to send
the constable to put her forth. This woman was brought to the
Court for disturbing the peace in the church, etc., and there she
gave such premptory answers, as she was committed till she should
find surities for her good behavior. After she had been in prison
three or four days, she made means to the Governor and submitted
herself, and acknowledged her fault in disturbing the church;
whereupon he took her husband's bond for her good behavior, and
discharged her out of prison. But he found, after, that she still
held her former opinions, which were very dangerous, as, (I) that
the church is the head of the people, both magistrates and ministers,
met together and that these have power to ordain ministers,
etc. (II) That all that dwell in the same town, and will profess
their faith in Christ Jesus, ought to be received to the sacraments
there; and that she was persuaded that, if Paul were at Salem, he
would call all the inhabitants there saints. (III) That excommunication
is no other but when Christians withdraw private communion
from one that hath offended." September 24, 1639, this Mary
Oliver was sentenced to prison in Boston indefinitely for her
speeches at the arrival of newcomers. She was to be taken by the
constables of Salem and Lynn to the prison in Boston. Her husband
Thomas Oliver was bound in &#163;20 for his wife's appearance at the
next court in Boston.</p>

<p>Governor Winthrop continues: "About five years after, this
woman was adjudged to be whipped for reproaching the magistrates.
She stood without tying, and bore her punishment with a
masculine spirit, glorying in her suffering. But after (when she
came to consider the reproach, which would stick by her, etc.) she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was much dejected about it. She had a cleft stick put on her tongue
half an hour for reproaching the elders."</p>

<p>March 2, 1647-8, Mary Oliver was fined for working on the
Sabbath day in time of public exercise; also for abusing Capt.
Hathorne, uttering divers mutinous speeches, and denying the
morality of the Sabbath. She was sentenced to sit in the stocks one
hour next lecture day, if the weather be moderate; also for saying
"You in New England are thieves and Robbers" and for saying to
Mr. Gutch that she hoped to tear his flesh in pieces and all such as
he was. For this she was bound to good behavior, and refusing to
give bond was sent to Boston jail, and if she remained in the court's
jurisdiction was to answer to further complaints at the next Salem
Court.</p>

<p>It appears from depositions that she went to Robert Gutch's
house in such gladness of spirit that he couldn't understand it, and
she said to some there, not members, "Lift up your heads, your
redemption draweth near," and when reminded what she already
had been punished for, she said that she came out of that with a
scarf and a ring.</p>

<p>November 15, 1648, Mary Oliver for living from her husband,
was ordered to go to him before the next court, and in December
she brought suit against John Robinson for false imprisonment,
taking her in a violent manner and putting her in the stocks. She
recovered a judgment of 10s. damages. The following February
Mary Oliver was again presented at Court for living from her husband,
and in July, having been ordered to go to her husband in
England by the next ship, she was further enjoyned to go by the
next opportunity on penalty of 20 li.</p>

<p>November 13, 1649, Mary Oliver was presented for stealing
goats, and a month later she was presented for speaking against the
Governor, saying that he was unjust, corrupt and a wretch, and
that he made her pay for stealing two goats when there was no
proof in the world of it. She was sentenced to be whipped next lecture
day at Salem, if the weather be moderate, not exceeding
twenty stripes. Capt. William Hathorne and Mr. Emanuel Downing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
were to see the sentence executed. At the same court George
Ropes complained that Mary Oliver kept away a spade of his and
she was fined 5s.</p>

<p>February 28, 1649-50, Mary Oliver thus far had escaped the
second whipping, for at her request Mr. Batter asked that her sentence
be respited, which the Court granted "if she doe go into the
Bay with Joseph Hardy this day or when he goeth next into the
Bay with his vessell" otherwise she was to be called forth by Mr.
Downing and Capt. Hathorne and be punished. If she returned,
the punishment was to hold good.</p>

<p>The next day Mary Oliver's fine was remitted to the end that she
use it in transporting herself and children out of this jurisdiction
within three weeks. And there ended her turbulent career in the
town of Salem, so far as the Court records show.</p>

<p>Until comparatively recent times New England shipping sailed
the seas in frequent danger of attack by pirate vessels. Before the
town of Boston was settled, Capt. John Smith, "the Admiral of
New England," wrote: "As in all lands where there are many
people, there are some theeves, so in all Seas much frequented,
there are some Pyrats," and as early as the summer of 1632, one
Dixey Bull was plundering small trading vessels on the Maine
coast and looting the settlement at Pemaquid. Shipping, sailing to
and from England, was obliged to run the gauntlet of the Dutch
and French privateers and the so-called pirates sailing out of
Flushing and Ostend made several captures that affected the fortunes
of the Boston traders. In 1644, the Great and General Court
sitting in Boston, granted a commission to Capt. Thomas Bredcake
to take Turkish pirates&mdash;the Algerines&mdash;who were a constant danger
to vessels trading with Spain. John Hull, the mint-master who
made the "pine tree shillings," had a brother Edward, who went
a-pirating in Long Island Sound and after dividing the plunder
made for England.</p>

<p>It was the treaty of peace between England and Spain, signed at
Aix-la-Chapelle in 1668, that contributed largely to the great increase
of piracy in the West Indies and along the New England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
coast. The peace released a great many men who found themselves
unable to obtain employment in merchant ships and this was particularly
true in the West Indies where the colonial governors had
commissioned a large number of privateers. It was but a step forward
to continue that fine work without a commission after the
war was over and to the mind of the needy seaman there was very
little distinction between the lawfulness of one and the unlawfulness
of the other. The suppression of buccaneering in the West
Indies happened not long after and many of these adventurers
raised a black flag and preyed upon the ships of every nation. The
operation of the Navigation Acts also led to insecurity on the high
seas and eventually to outright piracy; and so it came about that
the pirate, the privateer, and the armed merchantman, often blended
the one into the other.</p>

<p>The first trial and execution of pirates in Boston took place in
1672. Rev. Cotton Mather, the pastor of the North Church, Boston,
in his "History of Some Criminals Executed in this Land,"
relates the story of the seizure of the ship <em>Antonio</em>, off the Spanish
coast. She was owned in England and her crew quarrelled with the
master and at last rose and turned him adrift in the ship's longboat
with a small quantity of provisions. With him went some of
the officers of the ship. The mutineers, or pirates as they were
characterized at the time, then set sail for New England and on
their arrival in Boston they were sheltered and for a time concealed
by Major Nicholas Shapleigh, a merchant in Charlestown.
He was also accused of aiding them in their attempt to get away.
Meanwhile, "by a surprising providence of God, the Master, with
his Afflicted Company in the Long-boat, also arrived; all, Except
one who Dyed of the Barbarous Usage.</p>

<p>"The Countenance of the <em>Master</em>, who now become Terrible to
the Rebellious <em>Men</em>, though they had <em>Escaped the Sea</em>, yet <em>Vengeance
would not suffer them to Live a Shore</em>. At his Instance and
Complaint, they were Apprehended; and the Ringleaders of this
Murderous Pyracy, had sentence of Death Executed on them, in
<em>Boston</em>."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>The three men who were executed were William Forrest, Alexander
Wilson, and John Smith. As for Major Shapleigh; he was
fined five hundred pounds, which amount was afterwards abated
to three hundred pounds because of "his estate not being able to
beare it."</p>

<p>The extraordinary circumstances of this case probably induced
the General Court to draw up the law that was enacted on October
15, 1673. By it piracy became punishable by death according to the
local laws. Before then a kind of common law was in force in the
Colony based upon Biblical law as construed by the leading ministers.
Of course the laws of England were theoretically respected,
but Massachusetts, in the wilderness, separated from England by
three thousand miles of stormy water, in practice actually governed
herself and made her own laws.</p>

<p>In 1675, the Court of Assistants found John Rhoade and certain
Dutchmen guilty of piracy on the Maine coast and they were sentenced
to be hanged "presently after the lecture." Just then, King
Philip went on the warpath and all else, for the time, was forgotten
in the fearful danger of the emergency. Before long the
condemned men were released, some without conditions and others
were banished from the Colony. It is fair to say, however, that
politics and commercial greed were sadly mixed in this trial.</p>

<p>A bloody fight occurred at Tarpaulin Cove, near Woods Hole,
in October, 1689, between a pirate sloop and a vessel sent out from
Boston in pursuit. The pirate was taken and after trial the leader,
Capt. Thomas Pound, late pilot of the King's frigate <em>Rose</em>, then
at anchor in the harbor, Thomas Hawkins, a well-connected citizen
of Boston, Thomas Johnston of Boston, "a limping privateer," and
one Eleazer Buck, were sentenced to be hanged. When they were
on the gallows Governor Bradstreet reprieved all save Johnston&mdash;"Which
gave great disgust to the People; I fear it was ill done,"
wrote Judge Sewall. The same day one William Coward was
hanged for piracy committed on the ketch <em>Elinor</em>, while at anchor
at Nantasket Road.</p>

<p>The capture in Boston in 1699, of William Kidd, Joseph Bradish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
born in Cambridge; Tee Wetherly, James Gillam, and other
men concerned with the Madagascar pirates, created much excitement,
but these men were tried in England and gibbetted at Hope
Point on the Thames.</p>

<p>In June, 1704, a trial for piracy was held in the Old State
House, and the testimony and proceedings were afterwards published.
Captain John Quelch had sailed from Marblehead, the previous
year, in command of a brigantine commissioned as a privateer.
Instead of proceeding against the French off Newfoundland
he had sailed south and on the coast of Brazil had captured and
plundered several Portuguese vessels. While he was absent, a
treaty of peace between England and Portugal had been signed
and when Quelch returned to Marblehead harbor he learned that
he had piratically taken various vessels belonging to subjects of
"Her Majesty's good Allie," the King of Portugal. His arrest and
trial followed and with six of his ship's company he was sentenced
to be hanged on a gallows set up between high- and low-water
mark off a point of land just below Copp's hill. The condemned
were guarded by forty musketeers and the constables of the town
and were preceded by the Provost Marshal and his officers. Great
crowds gathered to see the execution. Judge Sewall in his diary
comments on the great number of people on Broughton's hill, as
Copp's hill was called at that time.</p>

<p>"But when I came to see how the River was cover'd with People,
I was amazed: Some say there were 100 Boats. 150 Boats and
Canoes, saith Cousin Moodey of York. Mr. Cotton Mather came
with Capt. Quelch and six others for Execution from the Prison to
Scarlet's Wharf, and from thence in the Boat to the place of Execution
about midway between Hanson's [<em>sic</em>] point and Broughton's
Warehouse. When the scaffold was hoisted to a due height,
the seven Malefactors went up: Mr. Mather pray'd for them
standing upon the Boat. Ropes were all fasten'd to the Gallows
(save King, who was Repriev'd). When the scaffold was let to sink,
there was such a Screech of the Women that my wife heard it sitting
in our Entry next the Orchard, and was much surprised at it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
yet the wind was sou-west. Our house is a full mile from the place."</p>

<p>Capt. Samuel Bellamy, in the pirate ship <em>Whydah</em>, was wrecked
on Cape Cod near Wellfleet, the spring of 1717, and 142 men
were drowned. Six pirates who reached shore were tried in Boston
and sentenced to be hanged "at Charlestown Ferry within the flux
and reflux of the Sea." After the condemned were removed from
the courtroom the ministers of the town took them in hand and
"bestowed all possible '<em>Instructions</em> upon the Condemned Criminals;
often <em>Pray'd</em> with them; often <em>Preached</em> to them; often
<em>Examined</em> them; and <em>Exhorted</em> them; and presented them with
Books of Piety.'" At the place of execution, Baker and Hoof appeared
penitent and the latter joined with Van Vorst in singing a
Dutch psalm. John Brown, on the contrary, broke out into furious
expressions with many oaths and then fell to reading prayers, "not
very pertinently chosen," remarks the Rev. Cotton Mather. He
then made a short speech, at which many in the assembled crowd
trembled, in which he advised sailors to beware of wicked living
and if they fell into the hands of pirates, to have a care what
countries they came into. Then the scaffold fell and six twitching
bodies, outlined against the sky, ended the spectacle.</p>

<p>In 1724 the head of Capt. John Phillips, the pirate, was brought
into Boston in pickle. He had been killed by "forced men" who had
risen and taken the pirate ship. Only two of his company lived to
reach Boston for trial and execution, and one of them, John Rose
Archer, the quartermaster, was sentenced to be "hung up in Irons,
to be a spectacle, and so a Warning to others." The gibbet was
erected on Bird Island which was located about half-way between
Governor's Island and East Boston. In the Marshal's bill for expenses
in connection with the execution appears the following item:</p>

<p>"To Expenses for Victuals and Drink for the Sherifs, Officers
and Constables after the Executions att Mrs. Mary Gilberts her
Bill &#163;3.15.8."</p>

<p>The enforcement of the English statute relating to piracy was
variously interpreted in the Colonial courts, and local enactments
sometimes superseded it in actual practice. Previous to 1700, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
statute required that men accused of piracy should be sent to England
to be tried before a High Court of Admiralty. Pound, Hawkins,
Bradish, Kidd, and other known pirates were accordingly sent
in irons to London for trial. But the difficulties and delays, to say
nothing of the expense, induced Parliament by an Act of 11 and 12
William III, to confer authority by which trials for piracy might
be held by Courts of Admiralty sitting in the Colonies. On the
other hand, the Massachusetts Court of Assistants in 1675 found
John Rhoades and others, guilty of piracy. This was in accordance
with an order adopted by the Great and General Court on October
15, 1673. When Robert Munday was tried at Newport, R. I., in
1703, it was by a jury in the ordinary criminal court, in open disregard
of the King's commission.</p>

<p>The Courts of Admiralty held in the Colonies were composed
of certain officials designated in the Royal commission, including
the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, the Judge of the Vice-Admiralty
for the Province, the Chief Justice, the Secretary, Members
of the Council, and the Collector of Customs. Counsel was
assigned to the accused to advise and to address the Court "upon
any matter of law," but the practice at that time was different from
the present. Accused persons in criminal cases were obliged to conduct
their own defence and their counsel were not permitted to
cross-examine witnesses, the legal theory at the time being that the
facts in the case would appear without the necessity of counsel;
that the judge could be trusted to see this properly done; and the
jury would give the prisoner the benefit of any reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Trials occupied but a short time and executions generally took
place within a few days after the sentence of the Court was pronounced.
During the interval the local clergy labored with the condemned
to induce repentance, and all the terrors of hell were pictured
early and late. Usually, the prisoners were made the principal
figures in a Sunday spectacle and taken through the streets to
the meetinghouse of some prominent minister, there to be gazed
at by a congregation that crowded the building, while the reverend
divine preached a sermon suited to the occasion. This discourse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
invariably printed and avidly read by the townsfolk, so that few
copies have survived the wear and tear of the years. From these
worn pamphlets may be learned something of the lives and future
of the prisoners as reflected by the mental attitude of the attending
ministers.</p>

<p>The day of execution having arrived, the condemned prisoners
were marched in procession through the crowded streets safely
guarded by musketeers and constables. The procession included
prominent officials and ministers and was preceded by the Marshal
of the Admiralty Court carrying "the Silver Oar," his emblem of
authority. This was usually about three feet long and during the
trial was also carried by him in the procession of judges to the
courtroom where it was placed on the table before the Court during
the proceedings.</p>

<p>Time-honored custom, and the Act of Parliament as well, required
that the gallows should be erected "in such place upon the
sea, or within the ebbing or flowing thereof, as the President of the
Court ... shall appoint," and this necessitated the construction of
a scaffold or platform suspended from the framework of the gallows
by means of ropes and blocks. When an execution took place
on land, that is to say, on solid ground easily approached, it was the
custom at that time to carry the condemned in a cart under the
crossarm of the gallows and after the hangman's rope had been
adjusted around the neck and the signal had been given, the cart
would be driven away and the condemned person left dangling in
the air. In theory, the proper adjustment of the knot in the rope
and the short fall from the body of the cart when it was driven
away, would be sufficient to break the bones of the neck and also
cause strangulation; but in practice this did not always occur.</p>

<p>When pirates were executed on a gallows placed between "the
ebb and flow of the tide," the scaffold on which they stood was allowed
to fall by releasing the ropes holding it suspended in mid-air.
This was always the climax of the spectacle for which thousands
of spectators had gathered from far and near.</p>

<p>Not infrequently the judges of a Court of Admiralty had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
brought before them for trial a pirate whose career had been more
infamous than the rest. A cruel and bloody-minded fellow fit only
for a halter,&mdash;and then the sentence to be hanged by the neck until
dead would be followed by another judgment, dooming the lifeless
body of the pirate to be hanged in chains from a gibbet placed
on some island or jutting point near a ship channel, there to hang
"a sun drying" as a warning to other sailormen of evil intent. In
Boston harbor there were formerly two islands&mdash;Bird Island and
Nix's Mate&mdash;on which pirates were gibbeted.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Bird Island long
since disappeared and ships now anchor where the gibbet formerly
stood. Nix's Mate was of such size that early in the eighteenth
century the selectmen of Boston advertised its rental for the pasturage
of cattle. Today every foot of its soil has been washed away
and the point of a granite monument alone marks the site of the
island where formerly a pirate hung in chains beside the swiftly
flowing tides.</p>

<p>What constitutes a crime? It all depends upon the minds of the
people and oftentimes upon the judges. Manners and crimes vary
with the centuries as do dress and speech. Here are some of the
crimes penalized by Essex County Courts before the year 1655,
viz.: eavesdropping, meddling, neglecting work, taking tobacco,
scolding, naughty speeches, profane dancing, kissing, making love
without consent of friends, uncharitableness to a poor man in distress,
bad grinding at mill, carelessness about fire, wearing great
boots, wearing broad bone lace and ribbons. Between 1656 and
1662 we find others, viz.: abusing your mother-in-law, wicked
speeches against a son-in-law, confessing himself a Quaker, cruelty
to animals, drinking tobacco, <em>i.e.</em>, smoking, kicking another in the
street, leaving children alone in the house, opprobrious speeches,
pulling hair, pushing his wife, riding behind two fellows at night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
(this was a girl, Lydia by name), selling dear, and sleeping in
meeting. The next five years reveal the following, viz.: breaking
the ninth commandment, dangerous well, digging up the grave of
the Sagamore of Agawam, going naked into the meetinghouse,
playing cards, rebellious speeches to parents, reporting a scandalous
lie, reproaching the minister, selling strong water by small measure,
and dissenting from the rest of the jury.</p>

<p>With such minute supervision of the daily life of the colonists it
can readily be appreciated that it was an age for gossiping, meddlesome
interference with individual life and liberty and that in the
course of time nearly every one came before the courts as complainant,
defendant or witness. There were few amusements or intellectual
diversions and they could only dwell on the gossip and small
doings of their immediate surroundings. But all the while there
was underlying respect for law, religion and the rights of others.
The fundamental principles of human life were much the same as
at the present day, and men and women lived together then as
now and as they always will&mdash;with respect and love.</p>


<h4><em>Are the Times Improving?</em></h4>

<p>Edward Johnson's estimate in his <em>Wonder-working Providence</em>
supposes in 1643, a population in Massachusetts of about 15,000.
There were then 31 towns in the Bay Colony, of which 10 were
within the limits of the present Essex County. The population of
these 10 towns was probably about 6,000. They were located for
the most part along the shore line. The same geographical area in
1915 had a population of about 360,000, or exactly 60 times as
great as the population in 1643, 272 years before.</p>

</p>

<p class="center"><em>Figure</em> A. An inner door, wrought-iron latch that may have been made by a local
blacksmith. Outer door latches were of similar type but larger. The lifts were made
straight until about 1800 and the thumb-press was not saucered until about the same
time. There is great individuality in the ornamentation, varying with the fancy of the
smith.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Figure</em> B. This latch was imported from England. It was cheap and in common use
between 1750 and 1820. The cusp, resembling the outline of a lima bean, and the grasp,
thumb piece and lift are always flat.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Figure</em> C. The Norfolk latch appeared about 1800 and until about 1810 was made
with a straight lift. The grasp is riveted to the plate of sheet iron as is the end of the
bar and after about 1825, the catch. This latch was commonly used in the 1830's.
After 1840 the cast-iron latch was generally adopted.</p></div>

<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Building Agreements in Seventeenth-Century
Massachusetts</span></h3>


<p>Few seventeenth-century agreements to erect buildings in Massachusetts
have been preserved. The following, with two exceptions,
have been gleaned from court records where originally
they were submitted as evidence in suits at law. They are of the
greatest interest in connection with present day restoration work
as they preserve detailed information of indisputable authority in
relation to early building construction in the Bay Colony. The gable
window, the second story jet, the stool window and casement sash,
the catted chimney and the treatment of the inner and outer walls
of the house have much curious interest at the present time. These
architectural features long since fell into disuse and only here and
there has a fragment survived. Two centuries ago the towns in
New England must have presented an appearance most picturesque
to our twentieth-century eyes. The dwellings seem to have been
studies in projecting angles, strangely embellished with pinnacles,
pendants and carved work. The unpainted and time-stained walls,
the small windows and elaborate chimney tops, the narrow and
curiously fenced ways, winding among the irregularly placed
buildings, all contributed to the quaintness of the picture. The following
agreements between builder and owner should help to solve
some of the debated problems of this bygone construction that now
confront those interested in the preservation and restoration of
our early New England dwellings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This contract for building the first meetinghouse in
Malden is copied from the <cite>Bi-Centennial Book of Malden</cite>, 1850,
pages 123-125. The original document then in existence has since
disappeared. The contract provides for the construction of a building
of the type almost universal in New England at that time, of
which an example still exists at Hingham&mdash;the "Ship Meeting
House," so-called. The square meetinghouse with hip roof surmounted
by a "territ," and at a somewhat later date supplied with
"lucomb" (dormer) windows in the roof, was the type of public
building in the Massachusetts Bay Colony that prevailed well into
the eighteenth century, especially in the country towns. The
"territ" or belfry seems to have been common, but only the larger
towns were supplied with a bell. The bell was rung from the central
aisle, the bell rope coming down in the center of the auditorium.</p>

<p>In the Malden meetinghouse, the "territ" was built as provided
in the contract, but for some now unknown reason the bell was not
hung in it but placed in a framework erected nearby, below a large
rock which thereby obtained its name&mdash;"Bell Rock," a name that
has continued until the present time.</p>

<p>Malden was able to afford the luxury of plastered walls surfaced
with lime, but the ceiling showed the joists and boarding.
In shingling the roof a distinction was made between long and
short shingles. The lower windows were made up with "leaves,"
<em>i.e.</em>, they were double casements, and each opening contained sixteen
feet of glass, thereby indicating sash about twenty-eight by
forty inches in size. The single casement windows placed high, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
under the coving, also were about the same size and undoubtedly
were fixed sash, <em>i.e.</em>, were not hinged. Two smaller windows on the
south side, placed just above the girth, supplied additional light on
either side of the pulpit. The deacons' seat at that time was located
in front of the pulpit and faced the congregation. The possible use
of brick for the underpinning is a surprising feature, especially in
a country town. In fact, the use of underpinning at that time seems
to have been uncommon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> This contract provides for the frame of a house and not
for a complete building. But it is of unusual interest for it supplies
proof of the existence in Boston of a house having two gables on
each side of the roof, <em>i.e.</em>, six gables on a rectangular building
twenty-seven by thirty feet in size.</p>

<p>Robert Taft, of Braintree, an ancestor of ex-President Taft,
delivered the frame, but before he had completed the work Bateman
entered into possession and set his carpenters at work to finish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the building. Taft brought suit to recover payment for the frame
and the Court gave a verdict in his favor, from which Bateman
appealed. From the testimony it appears that on the ground floor
there were two rooms, one of which was eleven by twenty-four
feet, and a space nine by eight feet had been left in which to build
the chimney. The "articles of agreement" required that Taft provide
for fourteen windows but he put up "six more than my Couanant
was." Bateman, on the other hand, claimed that the frame was
"the weakest slenderest and most dozed timber that hath been
Seen ... most of the timber Wany &amp; on many of the Sumers the
Bark left on to make it square and wch Indeed was the Occasion of
all this Trouble."</p>

<p>This house was built for a "shop keeper" and probably the long
front room on the ground floor was to be used for a shop. It was
located at what is now the southeasterly corner of North and Blackstone
streets, the canal to the mill pond being on the northerly end
of the house and the harbor behind it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The foundations for the first Episcopal Chapel in America
were laid in Boston in October, 1688, following a long controversy
between the local authorities and the representatives of the
King and their followers. Little has been known as to the details
of the construction of this building. Judge Sewell records in his
Diary, under date of Oct. 16, 1688, "The ground-sills of ye Chh
are laid ye stone-foundation being finished." The records of the
Church preserve no information and any contemporaneous documents
seem to have disappeared with the exception of this contract
for the construction of the building which is now printed for
the first time. The exact size of the building heretofore has not
been known. Rev. Henry Wilder Foote in his <cite>Annals of King's
Chapel</cite>, Boston, 1882, supplies no information although he states
that the Chapel was built at a cost of &#163;284.16.0, an amount that
probably represents the total cost including furnishings. In the
<cite>Annual Report of the Boston Cemetery Commissioners</cite> for 1902-3,
an attempt is made to show by a plan, partly based upon grants
of land by the town, the several enlargements of the Chapel made
at various times. Here, the size of the first building is shown to
have been forty-six by sixty-four feet, proportions quite at variance
with the correct size&mdash;thirty-six by fifty-four feet, as shown in the
contract here printed.</p>

<p>The windows, probably of generous proportions for the time,
were to be supplied with iron casements filled with "square glasse."
Iron casement sash probably were rare in Massachusetts at that
time. One is mentioned in the inventory of the estate of Edward
Wharton, of Salem, in 1678, valued at six shillings. Square glass
is most unusual. It probably was cut to size at special order as
diamond-shaped glass was in common use. In January, 1752, and
probably much later, "Diamond Glass, and 6 by 4" were still sold
in the shops in Boston. These glass windows were a source of
constant expense to the church wardens because of the popular dislike
of the townspeople and the antagonism of the Puritan small
boy. The first service was held in the Chapel, June 30, 1689. Four
moths later the church records show a payment of &#163;5.10.0. "for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
mending church windows." On November 5, 1691, was taken "A
Colecktion for mendin ye church winders" and a few days later
&#163;7.0.0. was paid out for the work. The next March, six shillings
was paid for "24 Squ: glas."</p>
